# TC (Wands)

| In Thaumcraft 4 there are four types of wands you can craft, though not |  | 2 caps, wand core | 3 caps, wand core | 2 caps, staff core | 3 caps, staff core | All types of wands can be used to form Mystical Constructs, such as the Infusion Altar or jarring Nodes |  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| all rods can be crafted into all four types (see below). Each has their |  | No limitations | Cannot use Foci | Cannot Arcane Craft | Cannot craft, cannot use Foci | Staffters can (also) act as Vis batteries to fuel things such as Runic Shielding or Vis Dynamos |  |
| own perks and downsides, and consistent recipe. Specifically: |  | No bonuses | -10% Vis Discount | High(er) Melee damage | -Vis Discount, +Melee damage | You can transfer Vis from one wand to another using a Vis Dynamo, Vis Relay and Wand Recharge Pedestal (albeit at a very unimpressive 4:1 transfer ratio) |  |

| Wand Core | Capacity (wand) [5] | Capacity (Staff) [5] | Vis Cost (Wand) [6] | Vis Cost (Staff) | Materials (wand/scepter) [7] | Materials (staff/staffter) | Special Property |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Impregnated Stick | 25 |  | 0, 5, x2 |  | Alu/Naga Scale | ------------- |  |
| Greatwood Rod | 50 | 125 | 20, 5, x2 | 75, 15, x1.4 | Stainless/Lich Bone | Energetic/Lich Bone |  |
| RBOIQB Rod [1] | 75 | 175 | 60, 10, x1.4 | 125, 15, x1.5 | Energetic/Lich Bone | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Slowly regenerates Aer/Ignis/Terra/Aqua/Ordo/Perditio Vis up to 10% when below that number |
| Silverwood Rod | 100 | 250 | 115, 15, x1.25 | 165, 15, x1.75 | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears |  |
| Primal [2] |  | 250 |  | 175, 20, x1.25 | ------------- | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | Gives equipped Foci +1 level of Potency, regenerates all six types of Vis up to 10% |
| Profane Rod [8] | 50 |  | 25, 5, x2 |  | Energetic/Lich Bone | ------------- | Can be bought from Heretic villagers, and can inflict Warp |
| Tainted Rod | 150 |  | 175, 15, x1.4 |  | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | ------------- | Regererates Vis up to 10% while in Tainted Land biome, and has a chance to gain Vis when the holder takes damage from Taint poisoning |
| Blood Rod | 100 | 50 | 115, 15, x1.35 | 150, 15, x1.2 | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | Drains LP from the bound player's LP network to generate Vis. Will drain health down to 3 hearts if LP nerwork is empty. Staves convert LP into Vis four times faster, but can kill their owner |
| Infernal Rod | 150 |  | 165, 15, x1.35 |  | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | ------------- | Regenerates Ignis Vis up to 20%, regenerates other types up to 10% while in the Nether, removes Wither effect and douses the player when in inventory |
| Livingwood Rod | 100 |  | 105, 15, x1.35 |  | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | ------------- | Converts Mana into Vis at a rate of ~48000 ManaRF per 1 aspect for each primal |
| Dreamwood Rod | 100 | 250 | 115, 15, x1.3 | 150, 15, x1.2 | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | Converts Mana into Vis at a rate of ~48000 ManaRF per 1 aspect for each primal |
| Witchwood Rod | 100 | 50 | 115, 15, x1.3 | 150, 15, x1.2 | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | Drains Ars Magicka magic to regenerate Vis, except Ars Magicka isn't in GTNH, so...does nothing special |
| Ichor Woven Silverwood Wand Core | 1000 |  | 250, 25, x1.25 |  | Osmiridium/Snow Queen Blood | ------------- |  |
| Blood Infused Wooden Rod | 100 | 60 | 110, 15, x1.2 | 145, 20, x1.6 | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Tungstensteel/Fiery Tears | As Blood rod, but faster and less efficient (though see Blood Infused wand caps). Staves recharge twice as fast as blood staves, but must damage their owner (potentially lethally) to do so |
| Warpwood Rod | 250 | 500 | 190, 15, x1.2 | 220, 25, x1.2 | Enderium/Carminite | Oriharukon/Carminite | Regenerates Vis proportional to player's Warp levels. Warp Ward disables the effect |
| Thaumium Wand Core | 80 |  | 75,10, x1.5 |  | Energetic/Lich Bone | ------------- |  |
| Void Wand Core | 160 |  | 175, 15, x1.2 |  | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | ------------- | Regenerates Vis randomly, up to 10% |

| Transmutative Rod | 75 | 175 | 50, 10, x1.5 | 125, 15, x1.5 | Energetic/Lich Bone | Vibrant/Fiery Blood | Converts between different types of Vis when incoming vis is over 90% capacity, and another type of Vis is below that |

## Necromancer's Staff Core [4]

Notes: [1] Short for Reed/Blaze/Obsidian/Icy/Quartz/Bone, which are all identical save for the type of vis they can regenerate [2] Staff Core of the Primals used to only be craftable into Staffters, making them useless for foci use. This bug was fixed in 2.4.0 [4] While it has a crafting recipe there's no recipes for turning it into a functional staff, so it's unusable [5] Scepters have x1.5 the vis capacity of wands, similarly Staffters have x1.5 the vis capacity of staves [6] In order, these numbers are the Base Vis Cost, Cap Cost, and Scepter/Staffter Multiplier. The cost of crafting a wand/staff is Cap Cost x Cost Modifier (see below), plus the base cost. For Scepters/Staffters multiply by the listed mutiplier and floor the result if necessary [7] Alu ingots are rarely dropped by Twilight Kobolds, allowing you to craft your first wand pre-EBF. Similarly Stainless Steel can be found as loot (extremely rarely in Twilight well chests or Wisp altar chests, and probably some other locations), allowing you to get those wands a bit earlier [8] Profane wands (and, presumably, Profane Rods, though I've not confirmed that yet) are sold by Heretic villagers. This technically allows you to get into Thaumcraft as early as the Stone Age, although you would be forced to rely on this rod - and the warp it generates - until you open up the Twilight proper

In addition to these wands there are three more that can be obtained in GTNH - the Void Aspected Whargarble Wand from Magic Grandmaster lootbags, Disposable Crystalline Wands from Thaumic Horizons, and the Crystal Studded Cosmic Neutronium Wand from crafting The VAWW is functionally a Void Aspected Silverwood Wand with a different name/look. Disposable Crystalline Wands are part of Thaumic Horizons' Rift research branch, and the CSCNW is functionally a craftable creative wand - 9999999 vis capacity, maximum vis discount, and free auto-recharging to max vis

| Wand Cap | Wand Description | Vis discount [2] | Cost Modifier | Vis Cost (to craft) | Requires Infusion? | Thaumonomicon Tab | Special Property |

| Manasteel Cap | Manasteel Entwined | -10% ATIAOP | 5 | 25 | Y | Apocrypha |  |
| Terrasteel Cap [1] | Terrasteel Nerfed | +80% ATIAOP | 1 | (who cares?) | (who cares?) | Apocrypha | Can damage nodes through >100% Vis cost |
| Elementium Cap | Elementium Kissed | -20% ATIAOP | 7 | 35 | Y | Apocrypha |  |
| Vintium Cap | Vinteum Bossed | -10% ATIAOP | 5 | 40 | N | Apocrypha | Doesn't require infusion |
| Alchemical Cap | Alchemically Crowned | -10% ATIOP, -20% Aq | 6 | 20 | Y | Apocrypha | Makes the LP -> Vis conversion of Blood (Infused) wands more efficient |
| Ichorium Cap | Ichorium Adorned | -30% ATIAOP | 8 | 150 | Y | Thaumic Tinkerer |  |
| Blood Infused Iron Cap | Blood Iron Topped | -15% ATIAOP | 6 | 20 | Y | Apocrypha | Makes the LP -> Vis converstion of Blood Infused wands much more efficient, disables the conversion effect on Blood wands |
| Enchanted Cloth Cap | Satin Entwined | -05% ATIAOP | 3 | 25 | N | Maleficia |  |
| Crimson-Stained Cloth Cap | Crimson Stained | -20% ATIAOP | 6 | 100 | Y | Maleficia |  |
| Shadow-Imbued Cloth Cap | Shadow Entangled | -15% ATIAOP | 5 | 50 | Y | Maleficia |  |
| Shadowmetal Cap | Shadowmetal Attuned | -30% ATIAOP | 8 | 40 | Y | Maleficia |  |
| Thauminite Cap | Thauminite Bossed | -15% ATIAOP | 6 | 20 | Y | Thaumic Bases |  |
| Sojourner's Cap | Sojourner's | -05% ATIAOP | 5 | 35 | Y | Thaumic Exploration | Automatically drains nearby nodes when held in your hand. Does not automatically recharge from energized nodes. |
| Mechanist's Cap | Mechanist's | -05% ATIAOP | 5 | 35 | Y | Thaumic Exploration | Drains nodes faster. Does not apply to recharging through energized nodes |

Notes: [1] Despite what some might call "all expectations" Terrasteel wand caps are actually unchanged from the base add-on mod in terms of vis "discount" [2] ATIAOP is short for Aer/Terra/Ignis/Aqua/Ordo/Perditio

| Thaumic Bases Bracelets [1] | Vis storage | Base Vis Cost | Frugal V Cost [2] | Effective Max Vis [3] |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| Iron | 10 | 0.7333 | 0.2788 | 35 |  |  |  |
| Gold | 15 | 0.6667 | 0.2121 | 70 |  |  |  |
| Greatwood | 17 | 0.6667 | 0.2121 | 80 |  |  |  |
| Thaumium | 20 | 0.5667 | 0.1121 | 178 |  |  |  |
| Silverwood | 23 | 0.6 | 0.1455 | 158 |  |  |  |
| RBOIQB | 25 | 0.6 | 0.1455 | 171 |  |  |  |
| Void | 27 | 0.6 | 0.1455 | 185 |  |  |  |
| Primal | 30 | 0.5333 | 0.1 | 300 |  |  |  |

Notes: [1] Bracelts have the same special properties as their equivalent wand versions, such as the RBOIQB's vis regeneration or the Primal's +1 Potency level to wand foci [1] Bracelets count as staves for the purposes of the Crafting wand focus [2] Vis cost cannot go below 10%, so consider whether your equipment's Vis discount is enough to skip levels of Frugal [3] How much Vis each bracelet effectively holds with Frugal V foci and no discount gear. May be significantly lower than a craftable wand or staff at a given tier

In GTNH you'll be crafting wands to craft wands to craft more wands. Careful planning and good use of Vis discount gear will allow you to go through the entire thing is 10 steps or even less. Otherwise...well, prepare for a wand museum. You'll be crafting more than a few of them Here I'll outline how to go through wand progression crafting as few unecessary intermediate wands as possible. Note that this isn't necessarily the most efficient/cheapest/easiest/etc. route, but the route that I would recommend taking when you start with TC in late LV/early MV

| Wand Progression (basic): | Vis cost to craft | Crafting Capacity [1] | Discount Gear [2] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1: Iron Capped Wooden Wand | 0 | 22 (110%) |  | You can get Alu ingots from a rare drop off of Twilight Kobolds or Slime Beetles, allowing you to start Thaumcraft pre-EBF |  |  |  |
| (Gold Banded Wooden Wand) | 10 | 25 (100%) | 27 (10%) | If you're going to do a fair bit of TC in late LV/MV grab this wand to avoid damaging nodes and open up the Bewitched Robes/Leggings discount gear. If you're rushing/waiting on Stainless Steel ignore this wand |  |  |  |
| 2: Iron Capped Greatwood Wand | 20 | 45 (110%) | 52 (15%) | This wand is just a quick, necessary stepping stone to the next one |  |  |  |
| 3: Satin Entwined Greatwood Wand | 35 | 52 (95%) | 62 (15%) | Very soon upgrading wands is going to require an Infusion Altar, but this wand is able to squeeze out one more big upgrade without. It'll make setting up the Infusion Altar and Essentia smelting much more convenient |  |  |  |
| 4: Gold Banded Greatwood Scepter | 60 | 83 (90%) | 100 (15%) | Crafting this requires Goggles of Revealing, Bewitched Robes and (preferably) Bewitched Leggings. With this scepter you'll be able to start moving nodes, albeit only using the basic method |  |  |  |

From this point forward upgrading your wand is going to require Arcane Infusion, and even better discount gear becomes available(/necessary). Wand progression also opens up more at this point, depending on what materials you've got access to One of these new options that opens up with Arcane Infusion is the concept of Wand Augmentation, described in the Thaumic Machina tab. The relevant research requires Mirror Magic from the Artifice tab to open up. Research it, it's very worthwhile Another, more Warp-y path (as in it literally requires Eldritch Epithany into Void Metal to open up) is the Thaumic Horizons research branch leading into turning an energized node into a Rift. From this you can craft Disposable Crystalline Wands, which are powerful...but can't be recharged in any way Ultimately the goal is to reach 450 Vis crafting capacity to craft an Ichorium Adorned Ichor Woven Silverwood Wand. Technically you only need 250 to craft an iron capped version, but this would require crafting an additional Ichor Woven Silverwood Wand Core for a one-off throwaway wand

Since wand progression starts to branch here (and quickly turn into a tangled mess) I'll start with outlining three distinct paths - two very quick (if not necessarily easy) paths to 450 capacity, and the "proper" path that will be well prepared for scaling the great brick wall that otherwise looms in the future In any case use your new Infusion Altar to craft Nano Goggles of Revealing and Nano Boots of the Traveller. And make sure you're got Bewitched Robes and Bewitched Leggings as well. This will provide 19% Vis Discount, of which every single percent will be necessary going forward

| Wand Progression (New Horizons): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 5: Disposable Crystalline Wand | 75 | 352 (19%) | 403 (19%) | Since this wand cannot be recharged it won't benefit from the Charge Buffer augment. With 26% Vis Discount you can reach 450 Crafting Capacity, otherwise you'll need an intermediate wand |  |  |  |
| 6: Shadow Entangled Tainted Scepter | 350 | 401 (19%) | 592 (19%) | A Crimson Stained Infernal Scepter, Crimson Stained Warpwood Scepter (Void Aspected with 20% discount) or Void Aspected Void Scepter also serve as the intermediate |  |  |  |

| Wand Progression (speedrun to the end): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 5: Gold Banded Transmutative Scepter | 105 | 158 (19%) | 230 (19%) | Transmutative wands are slightly cheaper to craft than RBOIQB wands, and have a much more useful special property besides |  |  |  |
| 6: Shadow Entangled Transmutative Scepter | 150 | 200 (19%) | 296 (19%) | You could craft a better scepter than this if you augment the above scepter, but this scepter will get the job done just fine, so I don't see a reason to augment two wands when one will do |  |  |  |
| 7: Ichorium Adorned Silverwood Scepter | 293 | 365 (19%) | 551 (19%) | The power of wand augmentation and Vis discount gear, on display. Also Warp. The caps can be substituted with Shadowmetal caps, which require void, tungstensteel and primordial pearls |  |  |  |

| Wand Progression (intermediate): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 5: Gold Banded Transmutative Scepter | 105 | 158 (19%) | 230 (19%) | Transmutative wands are slightly cheaper to craft than RBOIQB wands, and have a much more useful special property besides |  |  |  |
| 6: Shadow Entangled Transmutative Scepter | 150 | 200 (19%) | 296 (19%) | If you don't yet have access to Vibrant Alloy you can craft a Thaumium-Bossed Transmutative Wand instead, but that will require a Gold-Banded Silverwood Scepter next as an intermediate |  |  |  |
| 7: Satin Entwined Silverwood Scepter | 200 | 227 (19%) | 331 (19%) | The intermediate Gold-Banded Silverwood Scepter will have 211 Crafting Capacity (307 fully augmented), which may prove enough for the next step depending on which one you choose |  |  |  |

At this point wand progression hits a brick wall. Barring even better discount gear Satin Entwined Silverwood Scepters cannot craft better Silverwood Scepters, and with better discount gear (22% worth) all you can do is slowly crawl up the wand cap tiers until you decide to craft a throwaway Ichorium wand What's needed going forward, if wand augmentation and/or crafting a throwaway Ichorium wand are off the table, is exotic wand cores and upgraded discount gear. Tainted is not useful going forward from here as it's too costly in terms of Vis; Infernal, Warpwood and Void are outlined For the record, yes, you can mix and match paths if you so choose. All you need is a wand that has enough crafting capacity to cover the vis cost to craft a given wand/scepter. Just keep the percentage of vis discount from your gear in mind

| Wand Progression (Infernal Rod path): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 8: Iron Capped Infernal Scepter | 222 | 284 (21%) | 413 (21%) | Infernal Scepters require at least 21% Vis discount gear to not drown you in unecessary intermediate steps. This one is sadly unavoidable |  |  |  |
| 9: Satin Entwined Infernal Scepter | 283 | 351 (21%) | 516 (21%) | If wand augmentation is not on the table than this intermediate wand can bridge the gap between the previous and the next one |  |  |  |
| 10: Crimson Stained Infernal Scepter | 344 | 459 (21%) | 685 (21%) | Another intermediate scepter would allow you to craft a Void Aspected Infernal Scepter instead, but crimson caps skip this step entirely |  |  |  |

| Wand Progression (Warpwood Rod path): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 8: Iron Capped Warpwood Scepter | 228 | 468 (20%) | 679 (20%) | Like it's Infernal cousin this scepter requires at least 20% Vis discount gear to craft. A Gold Capped Warpwood Wand can also serve as an intermediate, but mind the cost of Warpwood Rods... |  |  |  |

| Wand Progression (Void Wand Core path): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 7: Iron Capped Void Scepter | 210 | 300 (20%) | 434 (20%) | Once again either 20% Vis discount gear or an intermediate wand is required for the next craft |  |  |  |
| 8: Shadow Entangled Void Scepter | 300 | 436 (20%) | 645 (20%) | With 22% Vis discount (see Voidmetal Goggles of Revealing) this scepter is able to reach 450 Vis capacity. Otherwise you'll need the below wand to cross that gap |  |  |  |
| 9: Void Aspected Void Scepter | 336 | 480 (20%) | 714 (20%) | Wand caps can be substituted with Elementium or Crimson, or even Ichorium/Shadowmetal if you're so inclined. 20% discount caps are the minimum, though |  |  |  |

Regardless of the exact road you took to get here once you've got a setup that is able to reach that (not actually all that, in hindsight) elusive 450 Crafting Capacity it's time to finish Wand Progression

| Wand Progression (The End. Finally): | Vis cost to craft | Discount Gear [2] | Fully Augmented [3] | Comment: |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Ichorium Adorned Ichor Woven Silverwood Wand | 450 | 2222 (25%) | 3289 (25%) | You could use Shadowmetal caps instead of Ichorium caps, though your milage may vary on which of the two is cheaper/less obnoxious to craft |  |  |  |
| Ichorium Adorned Ichor Woven Silverwood Scepter | 562 | 4285 (25%) | 6696 (25%) | For when certified overkill still just isn't enough. This is, without question, the very last scepter you need to craft (the creative wand notwithstanding) |  |  |  |

Notes: [1] Up to how much Vis cost a wand is able to craft at base, without any discount gear or other external modifiers. The number in parenthesis lists the wand's default Vis Cost given it's caps and wand type [2] A wand's Crafting Capacity given the amount of Vis Discount gear listed in parenthesis. There are ways to gain further discounts with a limited set of primal aspects, but this lists the capacity for *all* primal aspects [3] Crafting Capacity after a wand has received a Charge Buffer and Vis Channels augment, assuming the number of Vis discount gear listed in parenthesis

Getting a head start: You can, given some exploration and a lot of lootbag luck, unlock Arcane Infusion as early as mid-LV, when you first enter the Twilight Forest. In total you will need to kill Kobolds to get Alu Ingots (it's a relatively rare drop, Looting helps) for your first wand, find Stainless Steel as loot for your Greatwood wand (Twilight Wells or Wisp Platforms in the overworld are possible sources), pull Arcane Stone Bricks from a Magic Novice lootbag twice (enchanting the lootbag supposedly more than triples the odds of pulling Arcane Stone Bricks, but it's not great either way), and finally find an Eye of Ender as loot in a Lich Tower or get it from a tier 10 IC2 crop. Whether that path is worth pursuing or not is up to you, obviously progressing normally would likely be easier or at least a lot more consistent, but it is an option if you really wish to attempt it

Note that Primal Charms, required to craft Scepters, require Rose Gold, which has to be cooked in an EBF. So if you do rush Arcane Infusion as soon as possible that will be the first brick wall stopping further Thaumcraft progression

Tips and Tricks: For quickly recharging a wand in the comfort of your own base invest in a field of Primal Shrooms, from Thaumic Bases. They grow very quickly (and respond to fertilizer if that still isn't fast enough), and drop Vis orbs when broken. Transmutative Wands work particular well with them The best crafting wand you can get with pre-moon materials is a Crimson Stained Void Scepter, as other 20% discount (or higher) wand caps require post-moon materials There's a chance to pull the Night Vision Goggles needed for Nano Goggles of Revealing from an HV Lootbag. Craft a Thaumic Restorer and print Fortune III books to enchant them beforehand to have a better chance of pulling one, otherwise crafting it will require a Cleanroom

## Staff Tips

Having an amazing wand/scepter for crafting is all well and nice, but you'll need a good staff to go with it if you want to make good use of all those Foci and forming those expensive Arcane Constructs. There's no strict "staff progression" like there is wand progression, but I can still offer some suggestions

| Crafting Wand/Scepter: | Staff to be crafted |  | Vis cost of the Staff | Staff's Vis Capacity | Staff's VC (fully augmented) | Comment: |  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Gold Banded Greatwood Scepter | Gold Banded Amber Staff |  | 105 | 30 (19%) | 44 (19%) | While the capacity is garbage this staff will slowly recharge itself for free back up to full. Fantastic for the odd cheap Foci use |  |
| Gold Banded Greatwood Scepter | Gold Banded Greatwood Staff |  | 105 | 154 (19%) | 220 (19%) | The first staff you can craft capable of Advanced Node Jarring. Though when a (cheaper) Transmutative Scepter can do the same... |  |
| Gold Banded Transmutative Scepter | Gold Banded Transmutative Staff |  | 155 | 216 (19%) | 308 (19%) | The first major upgrade to a Transmutative core. Worth rushing for the ability to recharge it easier/more efficienctly |  |
| Shadow Entangled Transmutative Scepter | Shadow Entangled Transmutative Staff |  | 200 | 265 (19%) | 380 (19%) | Like it's scepter counterpart this will be the best staff for a while in terms of Vis Discount, so you might end up keeping it a while |  |
| Satin Entwined Silverwood Scepter | Satin Entwined Silverwood Staff |  | 210 | 328 (19%) | 469 (19%) | Higher Vis Capacity, but much lower discount. Up to you whether the capacity or discount is more important |  |
| Iron Capped Infernal/Warpwood/Void Scepter | Void Aspected Silverwood Staff |  | 270 | 416 (20%) | 600 (19%) | The best of both worlds. The caps can be substituted with Elementium or Crimson-Stained |  |
| Iron Capped Infernal/Warpwood/Void Scepter | Gold-Banded Warpwood Staff |  | 270 | 625‬ (20%) | 892 (20%) | Expensive both in terms of crafting cost and Vis cost, but that storage is insane. Can Experience Focus spawners without help |  |
| Satin Entwined Infernal Scepter | Shadow Entangled Warpwood Staff |  | 345 | 769 (20%) | 1.106 (20%) | Given the cost of Warpwood it's 100% worth holding off for better caps, if you're delaying doing the Kami research at least |  |
| Shadow Entangled Void Scepter | Shadowmetal Attuned Warpwood Staff |  | 420 | 1000 (20%) | 1.453 (20%) | The caps can be replaced with Ichorium, but if you're crafting Warpwood staves you've got Primordial Pearls to spare |  |
