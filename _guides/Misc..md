# Misc.

After visiting a Moon dungeon you get access to the Personal Dim through the questbook, a customizable dimension one can build an endgame base in or use as a bee/IC2 crops vault. One of the options for customizing it is the default biome, which has a major impact on bees/IC2 crops - most everything else, not so much. For early bees Plains/Forest is best, as most early bees require a Normal/Normal climate. More advanced and even some variants of early bees will require a wide variety of climates, however, which can ideally be provided by using Witchery's Shifting Seasons potions to

## switch the biome where needed

For IC2 crops, for reasons that are a complete mystery to me (though are suggested to be true based on limited testing), Jungle and Swampland are both optimal biomes for (non-salty root) IC2 crops that are allowed options for Personal Dims. Variant biomes such as Fungi Forest, Lush Swamp, etc., don't seem to have any obvious benefits over Jungle/Swampland in terms of providing the crops better base stats. As a quick point of reference:

Nutrients is dependant on biome and the presence of up to three extra dirt blocks directly below the crop's farmland block (the third block may need to be replaced with a crux block, to allow specific crops to grow to full maturity). Can boost with various items (Crop Managers only accept IC2 Fertilizer) Humidity is dependant on biome and the farmland a crop is planted in - hydrated vanilla farmland will provide a bonus, all other forms of farmland (Fertilized Dirt, Garden Soil, Enchanted Earth) does not. Provide water to crops directly (with a Hydration Cell or Crop Manager/Matron) to boost Air Quality is dependant on Y level, with 124+ yielding optimal results, and how many air blocks are surrounding a given crop - the exact range and number of air blocks that count I'm not aware of. Cannot be boosted through items to my knowledge

Tips and tricks: Satly Root grows better the less humidity it has, so planting them in non-vanilla farmland (read: Fertilized Dirt) will actually benefit them a little bit Spades can be enchanted with Fortune. Limited testing tentatively suggests that Fortune III gives slightly better yield (for both seeds and produce) than an unenchanted Spade, but a Fortune IV spade works the same as an unenchanted one(?) Regular Wheat seeds can be added to IC2 crops as 25 units of fertilizer, up to 51 units. Bonemeal/IC2 fertilizer adds 100 units, up to 100. You can add more fertilizer at 50/99 units remaining, letting you stockpile up to 75/199 units respectively A GT Sense - as in the tool - can be used to harvest a 5x5 area of IC2 crops at once. Obviously more of an early game tool than a lategame tool, but worth keeping in mind MV Crop Managers should require ~24 EU/t worth of power to tend to a field of 220 very fast growing crops, including applying water and fertilizer. As a rough ballpark higher tier managers should need around 0.1 EU/t per crop, *4 per tier above MV

## Boosting Indium Production (using IC2 Crops)

One thing nerfed in 2.7 is Indium bees, leading some people to scratch their head on how to produce decent quantities of Indium (whether the bottleneck be sphalerite/galena, alu dust or even oxygen). IC2 crops can be used to alleviate all of these potential bottleneck, but how many do you need?

For Sphalerite/Galena you can grow Galvania and Plumbilia to yield Galvania and Plumbilia Leaves, to quadruple your output of purified Sphalerite/Galena from the crushed version. 55 Galvania and 165 Plumbilia 21/31/0 crops tended by an MV crop manager in a Fungi Forest at Y:140, with Fertilizer and Water being supplied, planted in hydrated vanilla farmland with 2x dirt layers and 1x crux layer below, should yield around 2641 galvania/7856 plumbilia per hour. Or ~0.73 galvania/2.18 plumbilia/s, letting you quadruple one Indium dust worth of Galena/Sphalerite every ~2 minutes

For Alu dust you can grow Red Stonelilly to yield Red Granite Dust. 220 such seeds in the same circumstances as above - 21/31/0, Fungi Forest, Y:140, fertilizer+water, etc. - will produce roughly ~172614 red granite dust per hour, or ~2.39/t. Fully processed the ratio of red granite dust to pure alu dust is 26:9, meaning ~0.829875 alu dust/t. This is enough to produce one Indium dust every ~2.16 seconds

For Oxygen you could try to rely on red granite dust as well - its ratio of 12 red granite dust to 7 buckets of oxygen would yield enough oxygen to produce one indium dust every ~11.15 seconds, assuming the above configuration - but otherwise you'll want to invest into Sugar Beets to produce oxygen

Tips and tricks: You can also plant IC2 crops in Extreme Industrial Greenhouses, but don't. Assuming an LuV EIG you would only need 4 seeds instead of 220, and get ~7x the yield compared to an MV crop manager...but at a comical ~1622x power cost. If you're that desperate, have fun, otherwise cannot recommend Speaking of EIGs, an LuV EIG growing Lazulia will, without fertilizer, produce ~1.5 pure Alu Dust per tick worth of lapis. Of course the same caveat RE: ridiculously higher power cost applies, and unless you could somehow supply a little over 15.5 IC2 fertilizer per tick that number is not going to move Indium demand won't explode until you enter LuV proper, when many crafts - including LuV components - start needing Indium (albeit in trace amounts, I.E. one dust per 20 LuV motors or 2.5 Robot Arms worth). If you don't feel like setting up for Indium in EV/early IV, don't feel like you need to just yet Indium bee can still be used to triple the output of the galena/sphalerite method. Combine with IC2 crops, and you 12x your indium. Also in 2.7 you can get the Indium bee in IV, if you access the Bedrock/Cheese Ore Dim with an Awakened Ichorium Pickaxe. Though note the above tip RE: no real rush The best place to mine Galena is actual Galena veins on the Moon, Mars, or Ganymede (among others), as Twilight Cryolite veins contain less Galena per vein. Sphalerite is best mined in the Nether due to nether ore's innate 2x output, but can otherwise be mined on Deimos, Mars and Phobos (pre-T4) Using BM meteors to call down the ores needed to produce Indium? Well frankly you probably won't need any external help, but if you insist on maximum throughput efficiency the HV Mass Fab meteor will be short on Galena to process all its Spahlerite, so mine extra Galena to compensate if you wish

## Nether Furnaces

Often overlooked furnace upgrades, Nether Furances have twice the fuel efficiency of regular furnaces. Can be build pre-Steam machines if you find a Nether Fortress, or brave the bottom depths of a Roguelike Dungeon (and come back alive)

## Line Mode (GT wrenches)

Quick tip: You can sneak-right click air with a GT wrench (electric or non-electric) to toggle Line Mode. When in Line Mode actions like shuttering or (dis)connecting pipes will be done for an entire line of pipes instead of only an individual pipe section

Notes: [1] A quick overview of the various Bricked Blast Furnace steel recipes. Though keep in mind that BBFs can process much more than just iron and steel dust into steel - many cleaned ore dusts can be smelted 2:3 into ingots in a BBF or EBF (once you have one of those set up and running) [2] You can use Iron Dust or Iron Ingots for smelting steel, they're separate but identical recipes. There are also recipes that use iron blocks and 9x the non-block fuel (there's no recipes that uses both block versions at once, unfortunately), but they produce quantities of tiny ash piles that clog BBFs [3] Note that using blocks of fuel is more fuel efficient than blocks of iron as well - 2 blocks of coal coke smelt 10 iron ingots, whereas 18 pieces of coal coke only smelt 9 ingots. As such I haven't even bothered to list the recipes that utilize blocks of iron, as they are comprehensively not worth using [4] You can also use (char)coal dust instead of pieces if you happen to have gotten a bunch from small ores. Getting coal dust from regular ore is not worth it, since Forge Hammering coal ore (or breaking the ore with a GT Hammer pre-steam machines) will yield 2x the ore's value in coal pieces directly

Tips and tricks: You can use a BBF to cook steel dust back into ingots...or you can smelt it in a TiC smeltery and cast it out as ingots that way. Which, yes, means using a Lathe to craft steel rods in LV is 100% worth it to get effectively maximum material efficiency at the cost of a (quick) extra step The amount of (dark) ashes byproduct produced per steel smelt is directly proportional to the amount of fuel needed to cook an ingot. If you want your BBFs to continue running unattended for as long as possible use the densest fuel - read: Coal Coke Blocks - you're able to feed it with

## Managing early Coke Ovens/Creosote Oil

Just a quick few pointers on early game coke oven and creosote oil management, given it's importance in quick and efficient steel production (see above)

1. It's better to smelt Blocks of Coal into Blocks of Coal Coke than to smelt individual coal pieces, and compress them afterwards. The difference is minimal - irrelevant with a hopper feeding the coke oven's input, even - but barring automated refilling a coke oven will smelt two stacks of coal before filling up on creosote, or ~14 blocks of coal. Coke ovens only have one input slot, so it's the difference between half a tank and 4.5 tanks worth of stuff to cook 2. A coke oven takes 16200 ticks to convert a block of coal into a block of coal coke. BBFs will consume 2 blocks of coal coke every 48000 ticks when cooking steel. This leads to an optimal ratio of 0.675 coke ovens per BBF, or a "close enough" ratio of 1 coke oven per ~1.5 BBFs. As such unless you're going for some manner of early steam power build - which I wouldn't recommend, personally - four coke ovens should be fine. By the time you keep more than six BBFs running you're likely to swap over to blocks of charcoal instead simply because keeping four coke ovens fed (and running) constantly becomes a noticable challenge compared to mass producing charcoal and producing steel through sheer force of BBF spam 3. Creosote Oil can be automatically extracted from coke ovens in a few different ways. TiC Faucets are probably the cheapest and earliest method, costing seven Seared Bricks per pair - craft Channels with the bricks, than cut the channels in half with a saw to make the faucets cheaper. Faucets extract 144mb every 24 ticks and respond to redstone signals, meaning some form of redstone clock/timer will keep them active. Note that Faucets will only extract fluid into the block space directly below them, and GT pipes must be "connected" to Faucets in order to work. More expensive, though certainly easier to automate/more compact alternatives for extracting creosote oil is GT Pumps, or Extra Utilities Transfer Node (Liquid) 4. Transporting Creosote Oil around early game automatically is best done with GT Wooden Fluid Pipes. TiC channels are unfortunately unreliable, and wooden pipes have much higher throughput limits than channels, while still being very cheap to craft. GT Wooden fluid pipes can handle a maximum of Floor(fluid capacity/144) coke ovens on their line before there's a risk of Faucets turning off prematurely. Which, if you've got them automated, isn't something to be concerned about anyway

So you've got an optimal ratio of coke ovens, you've got their input/output as automated as you need to, and you've got the lot of them fed on coal blocks producing blocks of coal coke. What about the elephant in the room, namely what are you going to do with all of this excess creosote oil? Each coke oven has a maximum storage of 64 buckets worth, those are going to fill up fast if you're not using creosote oil for anything while you're burning blocks of coal coke by the dozen. Here's options:

1. Build a Railcraft Tank to store extra Creosote Oil. A minimum size iron tank holds 720 buckets, or 11.25 coke ovens worth of Creosote. "But why store more of it if it's already useless to begin with? Wouldn't it be better to invest those resources into a tank to store steam instead?" you ask. And yes, that is certainly a valid point, but it depends on how you choose to tackle the early steam age. If you're the kind to rely on passive steam income from solar boilers and perhaps a few solid GT boilers, crafting a tank to store creosote oil indeed makes little to no sense. However if you've got a small-ish liquid/solid fuelled Railcraft boiler (buckets of creosote oil are valid for a solid-fuelled railcraft boiler) producing steam you can effectively multiply your steam buffer by storing the fuel instead of the produced steam. It'll take some juggling to keep the steam running consistently with such a system, but if you can manage that dance you'll have a much more effective steam buffer 2. Craft Torches. One bucket of Creosote turns into 5 torches (6 through an Assembling Machine), which will take a lot of pressure off of your (char)coal/lignite coal supplies in that regard. The only caveat is that this will require a wool per craft, which - absent sheep and hard to craft Shears - means 5 (three with an Assembling Machine) string per, meaning 15 (6-10 with a Wiremill) Cotton per craft. All the same a large cotton field is useful to have regardless, so if you've got extra, here's a use for it 3. Use buckets of creosote oil as a furnace fuel. Not everything accepts buckets of creosote oil as fuel - notably GT boilers don't (bar the advanced boiler, which won't return the bucket, so...not ideal) - but regular furnances will happily smelt 32 items per bucket. Double if you're using a Nether Furnace. Early game this will solve any sort of need for furnace fuel, no matter how much Wrought Iron from smelted iron nuggets you use for tools or crafting other stuff 4. Craft Binnie Compartments. Compartments are made in a Forestry Carpenter, and are chests divided into four separate, smaller inventories. I've never used them and have little idea how to effectively use them, but perhaps you'll find them helpful 5. Produce Lubricant. A Distillery or Brewing Machine - the latter being much faster and more efficient, but at the cost of needing Talc/Soapstone/Redstone Dust and a Brewing Stand to craft the machine - are both able to turn creosote into lubricant, which is both an essential component for progression (LV Energy hatches require lubricant to craft) and an essential fluid for the Cutting Machine. Do not, under any circumstances, try to cut a diamond block into plates without lubricant. The cutting machine accepts (distilled) water purely because Gregtech hates you and wants all creation to suffer 6. Produce EU directly, rather than steam. Creosote oil is a valid fuel in two generators - Combustion and Semi-fluid. If you're going to directly burn creosote for power there's no reason not to craft a semi-fluid generator for it. It gives creosote oil six times the fuel value, and is arguably cheaper than a regular combustion generator anyway (the former requiring two Tumbaga instead of Steel gears). Of course don't go crazy with them - semi-fluid generators might be good for creosote oil, but they can't burn regular combustion fuels (creosote oil is a bit of an exception to the rule in this regard) and creosote oil should only ever be a supplement you'll eventually phase out entirely, not your main power supply for longer than early LV at most 7. Craft Creosote Wood Blocks (and/or the stairs/slabs variant) in a Chemical Bath. These blocks do have some crafting uses - Impregnated Frames for bees, mainly - but can otherwise be used as a decorative block that doesn't allow mobs to spawn on them. Creosote wood blocks have the same standard wood bark texture that oak/spruce/dark oak/etc. has, but much darker than Spruce. Note that Creosote Wood Blocks are not immune to fire, and can burn if exposed to fire

Tips and tricks: Giving a bucket of Creosote Oil to a cold, minimum size low pressure Railcraft boiler produces 95840mb steam in either a solid or liquid one - 2.5.0 fixed the quirk where buckets of creosote used to be more fuel dense than a bucket worth of the fluid GT fluid pipes have a throughput equal to half their capacity every half second, or in other words, effectively what is listed on their tooltip. The idea of them having 50% their capacity as throughput it technically correct, they just have that every 10 ticks

## Extra Utilities Filing Cabinets

Extra Utilities Filing Cabinets are changed significantly from their default ingame NEI text description. In GTNH regular Filing Cabinets will store 1728 items - as much as a completely filled vanilla chest - even if the item in question stacks. Filing Cabinets also retain their inventory when broken, allowing you to transport them without dollies (and their penalties) on the cheap. Do note that remote miners will require many cabinets to store all the ores - a total of 10 should be enough to hold even a Nether Redstone vein mined out by an HV miner - but all the same it's an option absent Compressed Chests

Advanced Filing Cabinets work as the ingame text claims: Can only store 540 items that don't stack, making their uses more limited. Still great as a buffer chest for enchanted armor in a mob farm or dump storage for random potions you get

## Maintenance EU/t cost

For the record, since the questbook/wiki doesn't clarify this: Multis that suffer from maintenance issues lose 10% efficiency per issue, until at all six issues they shut down completely. Multis that draw power consume 1/(efficiency as a fraction) times more power than normal, I.E. a multi with five issues consumes 1/0.5=2x more EU/t than it normally would. Multis that produce power will produce less power per issue in a similar manner, and can have other penalities RE: Not producing the full amount of a byproduct output (LHE/LST distilled water in example) depending on the exact multi

## Color-Coding Tools

When you start getting multiple tiers of machines it's a very good idea to get into the habit of color-coding the power cables so you can tell at a glance what tier the cable is. Of course pipes, machines, and others can also be colored. Note that if you wish to remove a machine's coat of paint you can't break and replace it, you can right-click it with a bucket of water to wash the paint off. Cables you can simply break/replace. With Alu you'll have access to the Spray Can Solvent, which is basically a spray can version of buckets of water. 1024 uses per can, which takes four buckets of Acetone to fill

| Coloring Tools | Repairable? [1] | Uses [2] | Special |  |  |  |  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Spray Can (IC2) | Can be refilled | 512 | Can paint Wireless Connectors |  |  |  |  |
| Paint Brush (OpenBlocks) | Can be refilled | 23 |  |  |  |  |  |
| Paintbrush (Buildcraft) | Yes | 64 | Uses durability in Creative |  |  |  |  |
| Painter (IC2) | Yes | 32 |  |  |  |  |  |
| Color Applicator (AE2) | Can be recharged | Complicated... | Can undye AE2 cables/paint Wireless Connectors |  |  |  |  |
| Infinite Spray Can |  | Yes | Includes infinite Solvent, can paint Wireless Connectors |  |  |  |  |

Notes: [1] Repairable in a Thaumic Restorer, specifically. Note that none of the tools listed here will break when they run out of paint, so all of them can be recharged/refilled with paint and reused after running through their full number of uses [2] The Color Applicator is an odd duck. It can store between 176 and 4032 paintballs of 17 to 1 different color(s) respectively, and has 200 uses worth of AE battery charge (draining 100AE or 50EU per use). Sneak-scroll wheel to swap between colors. Paintballs are crafted from Matter Balls, which are [2] made in a Matter Condenser, which account for 16 of the 17 possible colors. The Lumen ones are, to my knowledge, unused/uncraftable. The last color is Fluix, or undyed, which uses Snowballs as a paint ball equivalent. "Fluix" as a color does not work as solvent, but can undye AE2 cables

No matter how you try to co-ordinate your color-coding somewhere down the line it's going to become a bizarre mess. Really you can do whatever you want, the above is obviously just a suggestion, so long as you stick to two principles: Write down your system. Using random colors is fine and all, but if you don't have a means to remember what color corresponds to which tier of cable the point of coloring them is moot. An ingame written book will get this job done just fine Never use similar colors for adjacent tiers. The point is to have different tiers be disinguishable at a glance. Light Græy and regular Græy right next to each other will not accomplish this. Ideally have two tiers between similar colors

| Miner Tier [1] | Maximum Range | Power Input | Fortune Bonus (Small Ores / Large Ores) [2] |  | Ticks/ore [3] |  |  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| Basic Miner | 17x17 | 8 EU/t | 1 / 0 |  | 160 |  |  |
| Good Miner | 33x33 | 32 EU/t | 2 / 0 |  | 80 |  |  |

| Ore Drilling Plant IV | 288x288 | 3072 EU/t | 7 / 11 |  | 15 |  |  |

Notes: [1] The first three miners listed are single block machines, the latter four are multiblocks. Though called Ore Drilling Rigs ingame I tend to refer to the multiblocks as Multiblock Miners instead, hence the MBM abbreviation instead of ODR [2] MBMs "give(s) ~3x as much crushed ore vs normal processing". Normal processing means a Macerator to get 2x yield, MBMs get ~6x yield per large ore. This effectively gives MBMs a Fortune bonus of 11, or Macerator+Fortune 5 [2] If this seems a wee bit on the "insanely powerful" side, it is. After some more testing MBMs did, in fact, yield maceration byproducts from large ores which simply could not have been gotten any other concievable way. So invest in MBMs [3] For MBMs this number assumes the lowest valid energy tier (MV/HV/EV/IV for T1/T2/T3/T4 respectively). Like most machines overclocking MBMs doubles their operating speed at the cost of quadrupling EU/t consumption

Tips and tricks: MBM mysteriously getting stuck? Ensure you've got a better output bus than LV on them. Between crushed ore, byproducts, stone dust, etc., a mining operation might yield more than four unique items in one operation. Which clogs an LV output bus

If you're relying on local storage for a MBM (likely Compressed Chests) consider adding drawers for the local variety of Stone Dust, as well as it's Impure version. They're likely to be the most common items, reducing strain on your compressed chests Similarly, if an ore mined yields more crushed ore than usual (redstone and apatite are two major examples) give them dedicated drawer storage as well. This is especially necessary when mining Nether ores, as they yield double the crushed on top. The number of compressed chests needed to store a given MBM run's ores varies wildly depending on what is being mined - particularly nightmarish cases can require as much as 18 compressed chests for crushed redstone ore alone, whereas other cases don't need that many for the entire run. Very broadly speaking, assuming drawers dedicated to (impure) stone dust and problematic ores, I'd recommend ~8-12 compressed chest for a T1 MBM, 16-24 for a T2. Again, though, it varies very wildly

MBMs consume 2 buckets of Drilling Fluid per block mined, and depending on the density of a given vein a single chunk can contain over 1000 blocks worth of stuff to mine. The easiest solution for this is Ender Tanks, of course, but you can also use GT Super Tanks as oversized cells to carry up to a stack of super tanks worth of fluid, and place them in the input slot of a super tank to automatically refill the super tank using spare super tanks. You'll need roughly up to a dozen Super Tank Is worth of Drilling Fluid to keep a T1 MBM going through a max size run on particularly dense veins, so average runs should manage comfortably with that much. You could also produce drilling fluid locally, but why bother when you've got super tank "cells"

Interdim item/fluid transport is possible pre-Moon! It requires diving into TC and getting Eldritch Epiphany (that's the 30+ warp one, not the 50+ warp one), but you can set up miners to automatically send their stuff to a central collection point as early as mid-late HV - the technological bottleneck will be Vibrant Alloy, which requires Nichrome Coils, and the magical gate will be both research (Eldritch Epiphany, as said), Arcane Infusion, and almost certainly energized nodes for Ordo centi-vis. With all that available you can set up interdim item/fluid transport pre-Moon, albeit less conveniently than the post-IV Lootbag era but convenient enough all told. See Mirror Magic in the TC (Tools) tab for more information

Deathly allergic to magic, and you want interdim item/fluid logistics despite IV lootbags conspiring against you? First off my condolences for the part of the pack where you suddenly have to reach endgame in three or four magic mods out of nowhere, have fun with that. For right now there is a tech based method of interdim item/fluid logistics available in EV - Dimensional Transceivers. In fact you might have gotten some from your IV lootbags already and not even noticed/realized what they can do. Dim Transceivers require a passive 500 RF/t to work, but once set up and configured (especially the configured part, don't get tripped by the block defaulting to an empty whitelist) are able to send items, fluids, RF, and minecarts - yes, minecarts, you did in fact hear that correctly - interdimensionally. Yes, you can wirelessly send RF power to a Dim Transceiver to give it its passive 500 RF/t, that power does not have to be supplied locally in general or even just initially. The downside to these things is that crafting them is more than just moderately painful, but for that you do get a nice all-in-one package that's a hell of a lot cheaper to maintain, power-wise, than a Quantum Ring from AE2 would be (No, you unfortunately cannot send yourself through a Dim Transceiver by catching a ride into a teleporting minecart)

Keep in mind that ore veins are highly variable in how spread out they are, as well as the maximum range of miners. A "depleted" vein might have over two-thirds of it's ore still waiting in the ground, if you're using low tier miners on spread out veins Similarly, once you get to MBMs keep an eye on their range. A T1 MBM's 6x6 chunk mining range is perfect for completely mining out a 2x2 set of ore veins (excluding veins so large they apprear in neighbouring veins). Also keep in mind that while there's no direct benefit like there is with fluid drilling rigs, you can use a screwdriver to configure a MBM's range in 16 block radius intervals. If you only want to mine out specific veins, or make sure veins are mined out completely, use this feature

With single block miners you have to manually chuckload the entire area that they are mining. With multiblock miners you only need to chunkload the miner itself - chunks it's mining the miner will (un)load itself so long as the miner itself is loaded

| Fluid Drilling Rig [1] | Max Range | Power Input | Minimum Energy Hatch | Ticks/operation (1x1) [2] | T/o (2x2) [2] | T/o (4x4) [2] | T/o (8x8) [2] |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| T1 Oil/Gas/Fluid Drilling Rig | 1x1 | ~112 EU/t | MV | 8 |  |  |  |
| T2 Oil/Gas/Fluid Drilling Rig | 2x2 | ~448 EU/t | HV | 2 | 8 |  |  |
| T3 Oil/Gas/Fluid Drilling Rig | 4x4 | ~1792 EU/t | EV | 1 | 2 | 8 |  |
| T4 Oil/Gas/Fluid Drilling Rig | 8x8 | ~7168 EU/t | IV | 1 | 1 | 2 | 8 |

Notes: [1] Each tier of fluid drilling rig at their default range/energy tier (with noticeable exception of the Infinite version) drills 50% of a fluid field's listed value per operation, rounded down if necessary [1] In versions prior to 2.5.0 fluid drills would gain an additional flat +25% yield bonus per tier overclocked beyond 1t. In 2.5.0 this yield bonus seems to apply to every overclocked tier, not just those that overclock the multi beyond 1t [1] Note that, after testing, this yield bonus seems to improve pumping speed, not pumping efficiency. Basically an HV T1 drill will pump the same total fluid as an MV T1 drill, the former will simply do it faster than the latter (overclock aside) [2] How long a pumping operation takes for a given range setting. Note that there does not seem to be a benefit to reducing the range beyond the point where a pumping operation takes 1t already

For the record brief testing suggests Infinite Fluid Drilling Rigs (UHV) will consume 7/8th A of power to produce ~1.75x a fluid field's listed value per tick, assuming UHV energy and 8x8 range setting. UEV/8x8 increases the multiplier to 2x

## Traveller's Gear Keybind

Items you can trigger through the Traveller's Gear Active Abilities button, like the Mantle of the Raven, you can directly bind to the Active Ability 1/2/3 keybinds found under Inventory in the Controls menu instead. To do this hold the relevant item in your hand and type /travellersgear bind 1 (or 2/3) in chat. This binds that item to the Active Ability 1/2/3 key, meaning you can use that button to directly toggle/trigger the bound item

Notes: [1] How much faster a machine runs/how much more EU/t the machine consumes per tier upgrade. 2/4 is the standard overclock, 2x speed for 4x EU/t cost, though some exceptions (case in point: Mass Fabricators) exist [1] Mass Fabricators at all tiers can accept up to 10A input, although due to their overclock each tier after LV only requires half as many amps as the tier before. At EV tier a Mass Fab will only require 1A EV, and UV only requires 1A LuV [1] Also note that single block machines cap out at 1 tick recipes. Further overclocks beyond that instead reduce EU/t cost. Recyclers take 45t per recipe at LV, and start to 1t recipes at LuV. ZPM and onward only decreases power cost [2] What tier of circuits/materials you need access to to craft a given tier of machine. Meaning an MV Amplifabricator requires HV circuits, and an MV Mass Fabricator requires both EV tier circuits and materials (technically, material can be off) [2] For some reason the machines that require a higher tier circuit to make the machine itself stop doing so at LuV tier. Mass Fabricators and Replicators still require +2 because of the field generator they require, though

"So what can I actually do with this early UUM production I've set up?" you ask. Truthfully, not a lot. Replication is largely reserved for exceptionally expensive lategame stuff that doesn't have a reasonable (enough) crafting recipe to produce the normal way, or recipes where UUM is simply a required ingredient. Early game the best use for UUM is for runs that delay or even outright skip crafting rockets, in order to either produce necessary items you can't get without a rocket otherwise or to try and get stuff earlier than the progression expects you to. Barring strange challenge runs such things are

## few and far between, however

Some notes about late(r)game UUM production: In UV you get access to the GT++ Recycler/Amplifabricator/Mass Fabricator multi, which boasts 80% EU/t cost, 64 parallels when recycling, and tier*8 parallels otherwise. Since 2.6.0 its previously underpowered recycler mode was buffed/fixed by giving that aspect perfect overclocks, meaning that once you start using these multis you can (and should) start using UUA as a means to produce UUM more efficiently/quickly than using straight EU

(The relevant numbers for CPU production, assuming Batch Mode is enabled, for reference:)

Tips and tricks: Not sure how to reasonably produce 1.7-odd million items per tick lategame? Try a really high tier Extreme Entity Crusher with a mob that produces a ton of recycle-able items (blacklisted items include cobble, stone dust, all small/tiny dusts, nuggets and AE2FC fluid drops, among undoubtedly others. Full dust/ingots are fair game). I'm not sure what mob would be best for this, but at a guess I'd say that Redcap Sapper is probably a reasonable choice?

Not sure how to calculate a good CPU ratio? Scrap Boxes are 1:1 with UUA, which is 1:1 with UUM. You also don't have to worry about compressing scrap into boxes. There's an identical recipe that uses straight scrap, I used the recipe with scrap boxes purely for easier testing

## Passive AE2 Power Cost

Block/Item [1] Crafting Co-Processing Unit Crafting Monitor Crafting Storage Crystal Growth Accelerator Essentia Export/Import Bus Essentia Level Emitter Essentia Provider Essentia Storage Bus Fluid Discretizer Infusion Provider ME Block Container Cell ME Chest ME Controller ME Digital Singularity Cell ME Drive ME Dual Interface ME Export/Import Bus ME Fluid Auto Filler ME Fluid Buffer ME Fluid Packet Decoder ME Fluid Quantum Storage Cell ME Fluid Singularity Storage Cell ME Interface ME IO Port ME Level Emitter ME Level Maintainer ME Quantum Ring [3] ME Quantum Storage Cell ME Security Terminal ME Storage Bus ME Storage Monitor ME Wireless Access Point [4] Output Bus/Hatch (ME) P2P Tunner Spatial IO Port Spatial Pylon Stocking Input Bus Storage Cell (per tier) [5] Terminal Void ME Storage Cell

## Wireless Connector [6]

Notes: [1] If an entry doesn't specify, for example, a full block interface or a flat interface it's because both consume the same amount of power passively. Listing absolutely everything individually would be insanely long and tedious [2] Power drain is measured in EU/t since that's what you will be using to power your AE2 system long term. To see how much power your AE2 network (plus attached subnets) consumes look at the Energy Generation value with a Network Tool [3] For a full Quantum Ring, plus Quantum Link Chamber. Individually the blocks require 110 EU/t per, but individually the blocks are useless, so listing the full amount per functional ring seemed more useful [3] If you're confused about what you need to create Quantum Entangled Singularities since "ender dust" doesn't exist in NEI, you need Enderpearl Dust and a Quantum Singularity exploding together to create Quantum Entangled Singularities [4] Wireless Access Points will cost additional power based on how many Wireless Booster cards are inserted. Zero cards costs 4 EU/t, 16 cards costs 20 EU/t, 32 cards costs 94.5 EU/t, 48 cards costs 441.67 EU/t, and a full stack ~2050 EU/t [5] Storage Cells drain 2.5 EU/t per tier of storage cell, starting at 2.5 EU/t per 1K storage cell and climbing all the way up to 20 EU/t per 16384K storage cell. Fluid storage cells follow the same pattern, as do Essentia storage cells [6] Wireless Connectors drain power based on the distance between two linked connectors. A one block empty space between them will cost 14 EU/t, whereas eight empty block spaces costs 50 EU/t. WAILA shows how much a single Wireless connector consumes in AE/t, which is equivalent to the [6] passive EU/t cost of both linked connectors since 2 AE = 1 EU. Note that the formula for determining the energy cost of Wireless Connected mentioned in the questbook could be outdated

## Directional AE2 Interfaces

Something you can do with AE2 Interfaces is make them directional by right-clicking them with a wrench (a GT wrench will work, but is subobtimal since it'll also open the Interface GUI at the same time. An AE2 wrench or Yeta Wrench is preferred). When an Interface has been configured to face a certain direction it'll push crafting ingredients only in that specific direction, and likewise will not accept AE2 connections through that side, meaning you can have an Interface send crafting items into another Interface without the two being connected as far as channels are concerned. Truthfully it's an outdated trick compared to more modern strategies as seen in AE2 only Assembly Line automation setups, but it might prove useful somewhere

There is a logic to what direction Interfaces will face when right clicked with a wrench, so take the two minutes required to learn the pattern rather than spending two minutes each time fruitlessly clicking an interface until you eventually stumble upon the correct sequence of inputs. Likewise the Interface has a unique look when it's directed so you can tell which direction it's facing at a glance given any one of six visible side. It's really simple, ultimately:

Directionless Interfaces will face the opposite direction of the side you right-click. The back side will show a small square to indicate that's now the back side of the interface. The front face will retain the normal Interface graphic to show that is the side crafting ingredients will be pushed into. The other four sides will show an arrow pointing to the front side. Right clicking the back side will flip the front and back side of the Interface. Right clicking the front side will reset the Interface to be directonless. Right clicking any of the arrows will rotate the front side clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on

## which direction you're facing

Note that all sides of a directed Interface can still be used for item/fluid I/O as normal. The only thing relevant about directed Interfaces is that they'll only send crafting ingredients one direction, and won't connect to AE2 through their front face

Tips and tricks: GT wrenches are annoying to use because they open the Interface GUI, but GT wrenches also have the benefit of being able to right click any of the six sides of an Interface from just one side with the same mechanic you're familiar with from GT's machines. And if you wanted to open a newly placed Interface's GUI to slot some recipes in/add pattern capacity cards/set items or fluids to be kept in stock/set blocking mode/etc. anyway GT wrenches are just plain efficient

## Vampire Pigman counters

In the Nether you can find special Pigman/Ghast type mobs who are borderline immune to most normal weapons. The solution is to use vanilla Wooden swords, Twilight Ironwood swords, or Extra Utilities' Kikoku sword. The last one has a regular crafting recipe in GTNH, so no need to go through the silly method of "crafting" it. All three weapons can be enchanted, though note that Ironwood swords will be crafted already enchanted with Knockback, so you'll have to strip it to enchant it yourself

## Extreme Entity Crusher optimizations

EECs are great machines for farming most mob drops, and can be innately sped up by giving it a sharp weapon - a Diamond Spike being the best, given that it doesn't have to worry about durability. Diamond spikes can be enchanted to make them sharper, but how sharp a weapon do you really need?

From (limited) testing it seems that EECs bottom out at 55 ticks or 2.75 seconds per operation from being given the sharpest spike possible. If you want even more speed you'll have to start overclocking the multi instead. How sharp the spike needs to be to reach that limit depends on the health of the mod being farmed - a 10 health pig does not require a spike at all to reach maximum speed, whereas a Staballoy Golem at 500 health requires a Sharpness 30 Wrath 30 diamond spike to hit the speed cap. Staballoy Golems are the bulkiest mob you can farm in an EEC by far, so 30/30 will be enough
