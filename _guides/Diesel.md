Note that this is not necessarily the optimal layout of machines for producing Cetane-Boosted Diesel, but it's the simplest (at least that I've found) for adding to a spreadsheet. Otherwise circular dependencies happen and everything is ruined forever

Tips and tricks: LCRs are able to share recipes within a single LCR, provided that the inputs and circuit setting doesn't conflict with other recipes and that the recipes are not in sequence. LCRs won't check for a new recipe to run until the current recipe runs out of inputs, so this makes sharing some recipes impossible LCRs get perfect/upgraded overclocks by default, much like EBFs with very high quality coils (relative to the recipe's minimum). This means an MV LCR will run an LV recipe at 4x the speed and 4x the EU/t cost, losing no energy efficiency (barring some literal rounding errors, which aren't relevant) Severely Hydro-Cracking Refinery Gas will yield more Methane Gas, but unless you're using a multiblock Oil Cracking Unit this is not actually hydrogen positive. In any case I'm not sure at what tier of OCU coils, if any, it becomes energy positive to use this method rather than distilling directly 2.7 changed the Hydrogen Sulfide electrolysing recipe to be twice as fast at twice the previous EU/t cost (144 ticks at 60 EU/t -> 72 ticks at 120 EU/t), as well as adding a recipe that doesn't use cells at all. If you find an odd reference to the old recipe, well, now you know why it exists

Rather than Light Fuel you can produce Refinery Gas for power early on. The downside is that this is less energy efficient per bucket of oil, 192K EU per bucket rather than 305K EU, but it lets you produce power using the much cheaper gas turbines. Useful if you plan on sticking with gas power

Propely using oil based power (Fluid Drilling Rigs, utilizing combution/gas/semi-fluid fuels)

So you've undoubtedly heard about how oil can be used to produce powerful, dense, and relatively easy to produce combustion fuels - and if you didn't, try looking up. While this is, generally speaking, the most efficient way to turn oil into usable fuel (in terms of EU per mb oil ratio) it's not the only method

What you're going to need to start diving into other forms of oil-based power is a Fluid Drilling Rig, which is going to require an MV tier energy hatch. Fluid Drilling Rigs can only have a single energy hatch per multi, and the T1 drill requires MV tier power to run at a minimum, so you'll need an MV hatch

Another thing you'll need is some way to prospect for fluid fields, since the fluid drilling rig doesn't pump up in-world liquids. Prospector's Scanners can prospect for fluid fields when they're used on Bedrock, although this is moderately inconvenient considering bedrock is (usually) not readily accessible. An alternative method is using Seismic Prospector machines (tier doesn't matter for prospecting fluid fields, LV to EV all prospect a 3x3 fluid field area). They require TNT of some description (Powderbarrels being the cheapest, and strangely also the most efficient) as well as a Data Stick, which you will need to claim from questbook rewards as they're impossible to craft until you've put together a Cleanroom. Fortunately you'll get some from the quest for the LV Seismic Prospector, which also fully explains how to use the block. So that's information I won't repeat here, given you'll need the quest anyhow

Once you start collecting information about what fluid fields are nearby you'll want to pay attention to the amount of fluid in a given field. The pack measures the density of fluid fields using two numbers - the lowest amount of fluid in a given field's individual chunk, and the highest amount of the same. These numbers are critically important because they determine two very key factors when it comes to pumping up fluid - the starting extraction rate, and the total amount of fluid that can be extracted before a field is completely drained dry. Exactly how both are calculated is, as the questbook puts it, "complicated", and for what it's worth I have yet to see a formula that I was able to confirm to be accurate ingame. But in absence of that I can instead give some general tips and guidelines

First off, let's make this whole "field density" aspect a bit more intuitive than comparing 226-376 and 256-413. Ultimately you don't need to do this, "bigger number = more better" works, but it makes it less confusing. To calculate what I like to refer to as the richness of a fluid field, add the two numbers given by Seismic Prospectors/Journeymap together, divide by 2, divide that by the maximum amount of fluid that is listed in NEI for that type of fluid field, then finally multiply by 100 to get a fluid field's richness as a 0-100% value relative to a field's maximum. Sounds complicated? I'll throw in a calculator

| Left Number (L value of a fluid field's worst chunk) |  | Right Number (L value of a fluid field's best chunk) |  |  | Field's average maximum L value (right number listed in NEI) |  |  |  |  | Field's Richness |  |  | (for the record, this is calculating the richness of |  |  |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 256 |  | 413 |  |  | 400 |  |  |  |  | 83.625 |  |  | a Chlorobenzene field on Mars) |  |  |

Confused why a field that has a listed maximum of 400 can exceed 400? Simple answer, at least what I think is the answer: The number listed in NEI is the maxium average of a field, not the maximum of an individual chunk. Individual chunks can go higher, but in turn other chunks will invariably be lower

Why is a field's richness so important? Well, to not put a finer point on it, "bigger number = more better" is rather literally the case here. The richer the field, the more fluid a field contains disproportionally. Actually calculating the amount of fluid a field contains isn't something I know how to do, but testing has shown that a 275 - 451 (90.75% richness, average 363) Chlorobenzene field yielded a total of 4222371161mb. Yes, that is indeed millions of buckets. A 3126 - 5135 (82.61% richness, average 4130.5) Distilled Water field, meanwhile, yielded a total of 557756451120mb. ~11.378x the density, ~132x total fluid yield. Obviously the difference is going to be far less extreme when comparing a 75.25% field to a 90.75% field of the same fluid (~1.2x density and 1.378x total fluid, for the record), but it still illustrates the point that fluid density is disproportionally important

So how rich do you want your fields to be? As a general guideline, >90% richness is fantastic, 80-90% richness is solid, 70-80% richness is perfectly functional, 60-70% is not ideal but if you've got nothing better it'll get the job done, and <60% richness is where you might want to look for a better field

If you have a sufficiently rich field, how do you make the most use out of it? The one weakness of fluid drilling rigs is that, eventually, the field will dry up - if not completely than at least enough so that it's no longer yielding enough fluid to support whatever power plant you've got that uses it as input. There are two ways to mitigate this issue. The first is to use higher tier fluid drilling rigs, as they are able to pump fluid from more chunks (up to the entire field at T4) at once. The more a drill is able to draw from the faster it is able to collect, and the longer it'll take before production rates bottom out. This also leads into the second suggestion, which is to never stop pumping. The issue with fluid fields isn't that the last third of it is somehow worse than the first two thirds, the issue that it isn't being pumped fast enough at that point. If you keep pumping and stockpiling fluid for the first two third, than when the pump hits the last third the power plant can continue to work by slowly consuming stockpiled fluid. The amount of fluid you get from a field is, as far as I know, static: Drain it with 64 MV T1 drills or 1 UXV T4 drill and it'll yield the same amount in the end. It's speed that changes, and what matters most

"Pray tell where I'm supposed to store that 4222371161mb worth of Chlorobenzene, which isn't too high a number in the grand scheme of things"? Super Tank spam or, realistically, AE2 fluid cells. GTNH does also add higher tier Railcraft tanks, but max size Palladium "only" holds 663552 buckets worth. Realistically you don't exactly need to worry too much about continuous pumping early on, when you can still upgrade your fluid drilling rigs. Once you're up to a T4 you should be able to craft 1024K ME fluid storage cells, which hold ~2G mb per. Barring oddities like Distilled Water on Ross128b that'll do

That all said, how do you turn the various fluids you can pump from various places into usable power? And for that matter, what is the best one to look around for? The answer to the latter question is Raw Oil, which is why it gets a special block all to itself further down. For the rest, here's a quick overview:

| Natural gas pumping rate (mb/t) | LV Chemical reactors |  | MV Electrolysers |  | EU/t profit (Refinery Gas, base fuel value) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 100 | 1 |  | 0.45 |  | 15791.55556 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Natural gas has only half the maximum density of other overworld fluid fields and isn't a very dense fuel, but it is supremely easy to turn into said fuel. Be careful using it for remote miners or very power demanding setups like EBFs, however. You might need a thicker pipe and better pump to compensate For the record, you don't have to worry about running out of natural gas any time soon if you find a good source. It is less dense than oil fields, but a reasonably rich field - ~71.7% richness - will still yield in the order of 2 million buckets of Natural Gas total. Ross128b has denser natural gas fields, as well

| Light Oil pumping rate (mb/t) | LV Distilleries (Sulfuric Gas) |  | Sulfuric Gas (mb/t) |  | LV Chemical reactors |  |  | MV Electrolysers |  | EU/t profit (Refinery Gas, base fuel value) |  |  |  |  |  |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 60 | 12 |  | 96 |  | 0.96 |  |  | 0.432 |  | 14866.91556 |  |  |  |  |  |

Light Oil is good for one thing and one thing only: Refinery Gas. Lots of Refinery Gas. Basically the same as above, but with much greater output potential given the denser fields of a (functionally) denser fluid. The need for distilleries is an unfortunate step, but the increased output speaks for itself

| Heavy Oil pumping rate (mb/t) | MV Distilleries (Sulfuric Heavy) |  | LV Chemical reactors |  | MV Electrolysers |  |  | EU/t profit (Heavy fuel, base fuel value) |  |  | LV distilleries (Benzene) |  | EU/t profit (Benzene, base fuel value) |  |  |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| 20 | 16 |  | 0.4 |  | 0.18 |  |  | 5889.955556 |  |  | 32 |  | 799.5555556 |  |  |

If you're not turning heavy fuel into diesel the simplest way to get power out of it is by burning it as a semi-combustion fuel. As such a fuel it has the same fuel density as Benzene, which is respectable...but also as good as it will ever get. On top semi-fluid generators can be expensive to craft, and pump out ten times the pollution that regular combustion gens or gas gens do...but of course you're playing with pollution turned off anyhow, so that's not a factor. What is a factor is the lack of alternative fuels. You will never run semi-fluid gens off of anything but creosote oil or heavy fuel, so the moment you choose to switch over to some other fuel all of the semi-fluid gens you've crafted will become scrap for the arc furnace. There are use cases for semi-fluid generators, for sure, but don't invest too heavily into them. They are not a long term solution, unless you go all in on heavy oil/heavy fuel

Also, yes, you can distil heavy fuel directly into benzene, toluene, or phenol. No, it is not worth doing that, as shown. The DT recipe equivalent runs about three times faster even accounting for the implied overclocks, so wait for DTs if you want to distil your heavy fuel within a reasonable timespan

| Chlorobenzene pumping rate (mb/t) | IV LCRs |  | EU/t profit (Phenol, base fuel value) |  | EU/t profit (Diluted Hydrochloric) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| 768 | 0.768 |  | 221184 |  | 10752 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Chlorobenzene is an odd duck among the fluids you can pump for power. Only appearing on Mars in fields that aren't really all that dense in the grand scheme of things, Chlorobenzene stands out because it needs even less processing than Natural Gas to turn into usable power - an LCR with a Reservoir Hatch, and that is basically it. The byproduct diluted hydrochloric can even be burned in acid generators to power either the LCR or the T4 fluid pump (though sadly not both), or distilled into hydrochloric acid. Usually chlorobenzene is pumped to yield hydrogen and chlorine, or if you want more hydrogen chemically reacted into Phenol to increase the hydrogen yield at the cost of chlorine (technically you could distil and electrolyse the hydrochloric acid for the missing chlorine and more hydrogen, or use the alternative sodium hydroxide -> salt -> sodium -> hydroxide chain), but Phenol is also a gas fuel...

| Very Heavy Oil pumping rate (mb/t) | IV DTs (Heavy Oil) |  | C9 HV DTs (various oil products) |  | Sulfuric Heavy (mb/t) |  |  | Sulfuric Light (mb/t) |  | Sulfuric Naphtha (mb/t) |  | Naphthenic Acid (mb/t) |  | Sulfuric Gas (mb/t) |  |

Very Heavy Oil is first accessible on Ross128b (and technically Europa, though that has weaker fields and is not habitable, meaning it takes more preparations to arrive and survive there), and stands as a shining example of how balancing a game purely by looking at spreadsheets results in systems that make no logical sense to anyone looking at how they're actually used. Heavy Oil received a heavy nerf in 2.7 because it had the potential to be crazy powerful as a semi-fluid combustion fuel...unfortunately no one remembered to check if that actually, you know, meant anything in practice. It doesn't. Yet it was nerfed all the same. This leaves Very Heavy Oil, which has zero uses beyond being a denser source of heavy oil found in a later part of the pack's progression, in an understandably awkward position. It was never worth looking at to begin with, mind, but it's listed here for posterity...I guess

| Distilled Water pumping rate (mb/t) | IV C11 LCRs (CO2 + Hydrogen) |  | HV LCRs (Potassium Carbonate Dust) |  | MV Electrolysers (Carbon+Potassium Dust, Oxygen) |  |  |  | IV C1 LCRs (Methane) |  | EU/t profit (Excess Hydrogen) |  |  | Bonus Oxygen yield (mb/t) |  |

Ever wondered if you could turn the insanely huge deposits of distilled water on Ross128b into power? Well, as it turns out you can, in fact, turn it into industrial quantities of burnable hydrogen. Do I recommend this as a power solution? Not even a little bit, but if you want to experiment with something that is definitely off the beaten path, this is an option. The bottleneck in scaling this will definitely be the electrolysers, so I'd recommend investing into a GT++ multi electrolyser - at EV tier it can process 8 recipes every 7 ticks, replacing 25 single block machines. Beyond that you will start to lose energy efficiency to overclocking, but if efficiency was a concern I suspect you wouldn't be doing this chain of processes in the first place. Another option is to tap into Ross128b's Natural Gas fields and process it into Methane, to remove the need for a recycling loop that cuts your output in half, but at that point you could simply be burning the refinery gas directly. Of course there's about a million other things you could be doing and/or have been doing for three or four tiers, too, so take the voice of sanity with a grain of salt if you're determined to run your base off of concentrated clown power

"Okay, so distilled water into hydrogen power is cool and all, but this simply isn't cursed enough", you say? Well, sanity has already left the building, so I can freely point out that one of Ross128b's ore veins is a variant of the overworld's diamond/graphite vein that contains a significantly higher amount of diamonds compared to the overworld version. Electrolysed into carbon dust (if you don't want to source it from elsewhere) this can be used to turn the extra hydrogen you're producing into more methane, which is barely a net positive process if you ignore the cost of producing carbon dust. From there you can either distil the methane into biogas in a single block distiller (more realistically a DT++ in distiller mode) or use a Chemical Plant to react methane with a green metal catalyst to produce benzene and byproduct hydrogen.

## Raw Oil Power (and getting the most out of it)

As mentioned previously Raw Oil is the most powerful fluid field to tap if you want to produce power, although getting the most out of it is going to require a fair bit of work - Raw Oil might be super free, but you'll burn through it fast if you're wasteful with it. First off, let's see how it compares on a basic level

| Raw Oil pumping rate (mb/t) | LV Distilleries (Sulfuric Naphtha) |  | Sulfuric Naphtha (mb/t) |  | LV Chemical reactors |  |  | MV Electrolysers |  | EU/t profit (Naphtha, base fuel value) |  |  |  |  |  |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 50 | 20 |  | 75 |  | 1 |  |  | 0.45 |  | 15811.55556 |  |  |  |  |  |

Later on - as in, circa HV - you can replace the LV distilleries with a Distillation Tower and add Refinery Gas to your supply of burnable gas fuel. This leaves the question of what to do with the Light/Heavy Fuel, though. You could easily convert it into Diesel, as you're getting both in the perfect ratio to do that without having any excess/shortages, but non-HOG combustion fuel is notoriously difficult to scale post-EV. You could keep some around for I.E. powering remote miners, but actually turning it into usable EU straight up is going to hit a brick wall in short order. As such the solution - if you don't want to simply void excess and find another raw oil field to tap into to compensate for the lost power - is to crack the light/heavy fuel into more gas fuels. The simplest, not necessarily the best, setup I've found for this turns the light/heavy into more naphtha, LPG, and excess hydrogen. Something like this:

Notes: [1] Naphthenic Acid and Octane are semi-fluid and combustion fuels respectively, but they're such weak fuels that it's not worth recording their fuel value. It would take far too many DTs to produce enough Acid/Octane to keep a single Semi LCE/LCE running constantly, producing a measely 6144 EU/t [2] If these numbers look bizarrely clean it's because I've used FLOOR to show how many LGTs can be fully supplied with fuel constantly. You can run additional LGTs intermittently to generate more power periodically, but this calculates how much power you can produce consistently [2] These numbers also assume the new rotor stats introduced in 2.7 (a minor difference from prior versions in most cases - HSS-E specifically got a nice 5% fuel efficiency buff), as well as utilizing the new(-ish) Loose Mode function added to LGTs in that version. This also assumes optimal flow rates [3] Directly electrolysing the methane into hydrogen will yield enough hydrogen to still make a net profit, but it will reduce the already aneamic amount of power profit that excess hydrogen generates to basically nothing. This block assumes that methane is chemically reacted with distilled water instead [4] A T2 DT++, or Dangote Distillus for those who enjoy their silly names, can process 12 circuit 9 DT recipes at 9 ticks per recipe, thanks to it's innate speed boost, at 5760 EU/t. This is equivalent to 42 and two third HV c9 DTs, if my math is correct [5] Number of OCUs getting way out of hand, but not enough so to justify crafting a mega version? Oil Cracking Units get significant energy discounts with higher tier coils, up to 50% with HSS-G. So if there is any multi you could overclock without feeling too bad about lost efficiency, it's an OCU

"Gee, that doesn't look nearly complicated enough"? Well, good news! There's actually one-really, two resources that went unmentioned in this whole mess: Carbon Dust (from electrolysing Ethane) and Carbon Dioxide (from LCR electrolysing Methane with Distilled Water). The reason they did - other than it taking me several millennia to figure it out - is because it would turn the spreadsheet into an impossible mess. The way to turn excess carbon dust into more power is to LCR react it with hydrogen into methane, than chemically electrolyse that methane with yet more distilled water to produce more hydrogen. This, in turn, produces more carbon dioxide, which you could electrolyse into carbon dust to create a functionally infinitely feeding loop, but could also be reacted with carbon dust to turn into carbon monoxide - a gas fuel with 24 EU/mb fuel density, or the second least dense gas fuel in GTNH

Let me just make it clear: You don't need to bother with this. You frankly don't need to bother with the whole "crack light/heavy fuel" mess either, if you're willing to just set more raw oil on fire. The only real cost there is the effort of finding another oil field worth tapping and slamming down a pump on it. All the same, if you want maximum power out of raw oil for whatever reason, it would look something like this:

| Carbon Dust per tick (Ethane) | Hydrogen | #LV Methane LCRs | mb/t Methane | Carbon Dust left | #HV C11 LCR |  | Hydrogen | #LV Methane LCRs | Methane | Hydrogen left | C11 LCRs | mb/t distilled | EU/t cost | Total Distilled | Total Hydrogen |

| 0.6026666667 | 1488 | 74.4 | 372 | 0.2306666667 | 14.88 |  | 2976 | 46.13333333 | 230.6666667 | 2053.333333 | 9.226666667 | 1205.333333 | 15187.2 | 1808 | 3898.666667 |

Confusing? Well it ought to be. At first you've got an excess of carbon dust, but after turning the first batch into methane into hydrogen you're suddenly short on carbon dust to do the full loop again with all the hydrogen you have, so the calculations change a bit to reflect the different bottlenecks. As for the CO2, if you really wanted to you could use the Potassium Carbonate Dust method to profitably extract carbon dust from one half CO2 and react that with the other half CO2 to create double the latter's volume in CO to burn in a gas turbine, but is it really worth it? If you think it is, go for it I guess:

| Total mb/t CO2 (includes both chains) | LV Potassium Carbonate LCRs |  | MV Electrolysers |  | Carbon Dust |  | LV C1 Carbon Monoxide LCRs |  | Total CO | EU/t cost |  | EU/t profit (hydrogen) |  | EU/t profit (Carbon Monoxide) |  |

In the exceedingly unlikely event that a series of wild, pack re-defining changes happen such that doing either of these processes is in any way, shape or form useful, rest assured that you now know how to do it. Just never mind the implied "never getting there in the first place", all things considered

Notes: [1] A Large Combustion Engine, when boosted, produces 6144 EU/t. Unlike a Large Gas Turbine it will not fluxuate based on fuel values, a boosted LCE at max efficiency will produce 6144 EU/t. Depending on fuel values and consumption this means LCEs can reach >150% fuel efficiency [2] HOG in a boosted Extreme Combustion Engine consumes 8mb/t to produce 32700 EU/t, resulting in an effective fuel efficiency of 163.5% [3] GT++ adds the Large Semifluid Burner, which is basically a LCE for semi-fluids. In it Creosote Oil has a fuel value of 48EU/mb and is consumed at a rate of 85mb/t, resulting in a fuel efficiency very slightly above 150%

Tips and tricks: Don't place rotors/turbines in Large Combustion Engine controller slots. They will not impact the amount of power produced, fuel efficiency, etc. at all, but will take damage as if they did. Why is that a mechanic that exists? Probably a result of copy-pasted code, I guess. Regardless, that's today's PSA

Universal Chemical Fuel Engine (mass combustion fuel burning)

6144 EU/t per multiblock power generator will quickly stop being enough power for your factory, and upgrading to HOG/Extreme Combustion Engines will only delay the problem slightly. LCEs do not scale well, and while ECEs can manage to survive one more tier they don't scale well beyond that either If you want to continue to use combustion fuels into late IV/LuV, you're going to need to put together a UCFE, or Universal Chemical Garbage Engine as I used to call it due to it's tendency to detonate upon world load. This will mean going out of your way and asking yourself if combustion fuel is worth sticking with over switching to another form of fuel - rocket fuel in particular will be a tempting option, given you'll need part of the infrastructure to mass produce rocket fuel to reasonably burn combustion fuel in a UCGE - but if you're committed to combustion fuel here's a quick FYI of what you'll need

The elephant in the room is combustion promoter, which you need to run a UCGE. The ratio of promoter to fuel determines the UCGE's fuel efficiency, but there is a catch - non-rocket fuels get a hideous penalty to the required ratio to maintain fuel efficiency compared to rocket fuel. This penalty is to the point where burning combustion fuel in a UCGE with high levels of fuel efficiency is impractical, as in the process of producing that much combustion promoter you could be producing rocket fuel and promoter instead. If you're willing to set fuel efficiency on fire, though, a combustion UCGE can work

To give a quick rundown of how to produce combustion promoter: You'll want to use the Hydrogen Peroxide (LOX produces less promoter per recipe and is very expensive to produce) and Saltpeter (Sodium Nitrate would require additional Nitric Acid, which is also very expensive/slow to produce) recipe Saltpeter can be sourced from bees or Salty Root IC2 crops. Hydrogen Peroxide is going to require a source of Antrace, which in turn is distilled from Coal Tar. Coal Tar is best sourced from Charcoal, but if you have I.E. a Redcap Sapper EEC producing TC shards/diamonds you can use the regular coal

Finally you're going to need a Chemical Plant to process the Antrace, which brings up the next complication: 2-Ethylanthraquinone and 2-Ethylanthrahydroquinone. In short: These are two fluids that are used in a closed loop when producing Hydrogen Peroxide. Producing Hydrogen Peroxide itself is a very fast recipe, but recycling these fluids is very slow, so pay attention to the recycling recipe when calculating how much peroxide you'll be producing. This recycling will be the bottleneck. Another point is that both the peroxide recipe and the recycling recipe can easily be put in the same chemical plant, albeit at the cost of adding a slight delay to both recipes as the machine switches between the two. Nevertheless an EV power, HSS-G coils, Tungstensteel Pipe Casings chem plant set to run both recipes with 40 buckets of 2-Ethylanthraquinone to prime the system will produce 24mb/t peroxide

So how much is 24mb/t peroxide, or up to 48mb/t combustion promoter? In the context of burning combustion fuel in a UCGE, actually quite a lot. Assuming you're still limited to IV tier technology, meaning a 64A IV dynamo hatch on your UCGE for power extraction limiting you to 524288 EU/t at most, you have a choice of burning 159mb/t HOG with 48mb/t promoter to get ~522235 EU/t at 131.38% fuel efficiency, or split the load between two UCGEs and burning 192mb/t HOG with 24mb/t promoter in each to produce 522816 EU/t at 108.92% fuel efficiency. Or something in between those extremes (for comparison, 24mb/t peroxide could also produce 23mb/t purple rocket fuel and 2mb/t promoter, producing ~208812 EU/t in a UCGE at 141.61% fuel efficiency. Combustion fuel can win out over rocket fuel in an UCGE if you're burning an entire warehouse of fuel, but rocket fuel scales much better)

Note that the UCGE can burn any combustion/gas fuel, from HOG to hydrogen. The caveat is that the ratio of non-rocket fuel to combustion promoter stays the same, meaning that less dense fuel either needs to accept less EU/t output, set fuel efficiency on fire even more so, or increase promoter input
