Notes: [1] Pickaxes/hammers start at the lower mining level and must mine X blocks to upgrade to the higher mining level. Other tools start (and stay) at the higher mining level. Note that replacing the head on a pickaxe/hammer starts it back to the lower mining level. Mining level 5 is needed for Obsidian [1] Note that TiC tools found as loot can spawn without Mining XP properly set, meaning the tool can never improve it's mining level even after changing the tool head. There's no known way to fix this, but /leveluptool will allow you to "transfer" your tool XP over to a new, functional tool [2] Materials up to and including Aluminumium can be crafted in a part builder, TiC smeltery or LV tier extruder. From Perditio/Manasteel onwards you will need at least an MV extruder until Infinity, which requires a ZPM tier extruder (for TiC parts, otherwise it needs UV power) [3] For crossbows only the limb adds to draw/arrow speed. Body only adds durability and material trait (though not intuitively). The Tough Binding only adds it's material trait [4] Alumite bolts are made in a TiC smeltery. The others require a Fluid Solidifier [5] This durability value does impact the amount of bolts contained within one set of them [6] Counterintuitively TiC crossbows deal more damage with lighter bolts. Both the bolt's tip and the shaft contribute to weight [7] Osmiridium only needs 150 redstone applied to reach minimum draw time (0.25s). Energetic Alloy requires 250 to get down to 0.3s, but any amount past 150 will be wasted when upgrading to osmiridium [7] Higher damage limbs do exist, but require obscene amounts of redstone to not make muskets look like machine guns. Min 600 to be reasonable(-ish), 750+ to be competitive. [8] Serrated is found on Dogbearium - yes, that is an actual ingot name - from Tinker's Defense [9] The increase to mining level mentioned in Material and You: Volume 2 is disabled in GTNH, but there is a bug: If you apply a Diamond to a pickaxe/hammer with Mining Level 04-Redstone after it's upgraded it's mining level the diamond modifier will increase mining level to 05-Obsidian [10] Obsidian (and some other) tool parts found in villager Tinkerer huts can be melted back down in a TiC smeltery. For Obsidian this is particularly noteworthy, as it otherwise requires a Steel pickaxe head (or better) to reach the required mining level to mine Obsidian. Also good for earlier Alumite [11] You can apply a mob head/Nether Star to a tool to instantly upgrade it's mining level, up to a certain mining level based on the type of mob head/nether star. This is no different from leveling it normally, it just skips the usual xp requirement. This modifier will vanish when swapping head parts [12] Note that the Auto-smelt modifier does not work on GT ores. It will work on things like dirt -> dried dirt [13] Regular Ironwood Pickaxes from the Twilight Forest also have a mining level of Cobalt if you're not able to find/scrouge up any Ardite. Twilight Steeleaf pickaxes are even better with a mining level of Many. No, this is not reflected in their TiC tools. Those have mining levels of 2-3 and 4-5 respectively [14] Crossbows are a bit inconsistent in that Quartz must be applied to the bolts (applying it to the crossbow just increases the melee damage it deals), but Lapis must be applied to the crossbow. It's weird, yes, but it's what it is

Tips and tricks: To get Redstone Dust without machines break Redstone Ore in-world with a GT hammer (the metal one, not a Soft Mallet). Craft the resulting Crushed Ore into Impure Dust with the same metal hammer, and wash that in a cauldron (throw in stacks at a time) to get Redstone Dust. Haste is really good! Alumite, which you need to craft a Tool Forge and/or high grade tool parts pre-MV, is made more efficienctly as dust outside the smeltery than combined inside the smeltery. Note that with an xp drain and seared tank you can craft obsidian dust without having to mine it and macerate it If you want to try and get a Tool Forge early search blacksmith houses for steel armor/tools you can macerate into steel dust, and purchace the needed obsidian dust with xp buckets. You will still need a steam compressor for the iron blocks to craft a tool forge, but you'll get Alumite pre-BBF A tool's levelling speed is proportional to it's mining speed, not durability. This uses the tool's modified mining speed, so adding Haste to a tool will make it level slower. For weapons it uses the tool's attack damage instead, though note that only the Quartz modifier affects levelling speed in this case Alumite/Blue Slime/Slimeleaf bolts do 15 hearts of damage with an Energetic Alloy crossbow. Use that if you're afraid of Witch Spiders reflecting your OP bolt back in your face and dealing enough damage to spontaneously combust your entire extended family
