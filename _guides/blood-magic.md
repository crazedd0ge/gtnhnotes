Notes: [1] Effect and cost of the Blood Magic compex spell combination which results in a mining spell (Projectile -> Earth -> Environment) [2] The questbook erroniously claims this tier only requires a T3 blood orb, but Power/Reduction/Potency Cores require at least a T4 blood orb [3] This number assumes the maximum amount of Spell Dampeners to reduce the LP cost [4] The minimum tier of Blood Orb (and Altar) required to craft this tier of complex spell

Notes: [1] How much LP a Blood Altar will receive per heart/mob sacrificed. This number assumes zero Runes of (Self-)Sacrifice, which give a bonus of +12% of the base yield per rune (I.E. the amount listed to the right) [2] These reagents are used with the Incense Crucible. Basically the 1.7 version of 1.12's Incense Altar, at least in function. Note that they have to be activated in order, meaning you need Wood Ash active before you can activate Byrrus [2] Incense Crucibles can be set up in a line. They'll automatically trigger each incenses in the right order, and emit flame particles when they're activating. The Dagger of Sacrifice will glow as well. Incense has multiple, but not infinite uses [2] Incense causes the dagger to chop off many hearts at once, leaving you with as little as one heart, but produces a *ton* of LP at once. It also gives you a brief Soul Fray debuff, although you'll need to regen your health first anyway [2] The number of LP listed is per heart sacrificed. Testing assumed only the base ten hearts, but extra hearts from eating/canisters/etc. can and will be used as well. Craft Capacity Runes to make sure your Altar can hold it all [3] Can inflict a brief Blindness and Bleeding debuff when used. The Bleeding debuff deals damage which will fill a nearby Blood Altar with some extra LP, but any active Runic Shielding can tank the damage instead and negate the LP boon [3] Glass Sacrificial Daggers can be infused by Incense Crucibles, but infused they don't do anything differently than a regular Sacrificial Knife that has been infused. No bonus LP, no blindness/bleeding, etc. [4] The Glass Dagger of Sacrifice, from limited testing, was fixed/changed since older versions where it could randomly generate less LP than a regular dagger would. Currently it seems to produce 1.1x as much LP, and rarely produce 5.5x as much [5] Galacticraft Alien Villagers count as regular villagers for the purposes of blood sacrifice. Unlike regular villagers, however, you can craft an EnderIO spawner of them. Witchery Village Guards also do, but they can drop a ton of garbage on death [6] The number of hearts/mobs that need to be sacrificed in order to craft a given type of rune. Again, this number assumes that no runes of (Self-)Sacrifice are present [7] The number on the left is the amount of hearts/mobs to sacrifice in order to craft one appropriate rune. The number on the right is the number of hearts/mobs that need to be sacrificed in order to pay back the cost of crafting that one rune [8] Starting at 15 runes Superior Capacity gives a bigger boost than Augmented Capacity. Of course in terms of LP cost 1 Superior Capacity worth of LP can craft 8.5 Augmented Capacity, so take that into consideration as well [9] The (rough) LP Cost of crafting one such rune. Separated into it's own block purely to make editing it easier. Note that the cost is approximate, since it takes 1000LP to craft 9 Arcane Slate, and a given craft might not use exactly that many [10] A new rune introduced in 2.7, this rune reduces the time delay inherent to automated Blood Atlar crafting by 20% multiplicatively per rune. If the inordinate LP cost didn't tip you off that this rune is "expensive AF", it also costs 2 LuV WAs per rune

## Blood Magic Progression

Blood Magic progression in GTNH can be summed up in two (four?) words: WoS Rush. As was hopefully made clear above the LP cost of BM was increased well beyond the point of reason, so the only reasonable path forward is rushing automated LP generation with all due haste. Fortunately GTNH at least doesn't skimp on generation - Extreme Entity Crushers can be configured to act as a source of mobs for a WoS ritual, making the process significantly more performance friendly

WoS is going to require a T4 blood altar (Dusk inscription tool), a T3/Magician's blood orb (50K LP network storage to start the ritual), Weak Activation Crystal, Master Ritual Stone, and 36 ritual stones. Tech wise this is gated by Titanium Screws for the Blood Orb. Magic wise you're going to want robust Thaumcraft infrastructure to craft dozens of items through arcane crafting/infusion, as well as some Warp (and possibly solutions for it) as a T4 blood altar will require 16 Void Metal blocks

In total, to set up a WoS starting from nothing, you're looking at somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1.924.500LP, or 15396 stabs with a Sacrificial Dagger to generate the necessary amount of LP. That is completely bonkers even for GTNH, so a plan is 100% going to be necessary if you don't want to go completely insane before your journey into sacrificing others in bloody rituals to gain unholy power starts in earnest. So, here's some tips:

Follow the Questbook Patience is a virtue There's no Geneva on the Moon If you stab yourself, do it well Better runes can pay off

## Thaumcraft Infusion required

For the record, using the Arcane Workbench recipe would shoot the LP cost up to 5.392.000LP, or 43136 sacrificial dagger stabs, or 67.4 stacks of TiC red hearts. So, eh, yeah. Strongly consider not skipping the Arcane Infusion recipe, perhaps

The Alchemy Rubix Cube, or "how to summon bigger, richer (by virtue of being bigger) meteors"

For as much as I have - and will - praise Orbis Terrae to boost Mark of the Falling Tower rituals the method of actually getting reagent into master ritual stones can be less than perfectly clear. To boost Mark of the Falling Tower rituals specifically you only require a few tools, assuming you make no mistakes - the Alchemic Router. An Alchemic Calcinator will be required to convert solid reagents into usable ritual booster fuel, and a Belljar is an optional component for ritual booster fuel storage

Alchemic Calcinator Alchemic Cleanser Alchemy Relay Alchemic Router Alchemic Segmenter

## Crystal Belljar

Set up an Alchemic Calcinator, and give it a bound Blood Orb to fuel it. Tier doesn't seem to matter. Next feed the Alchemic Calcinator solid reagents, either by right-clicking them in manually or hoppering them in. Now the part that might feel needlessly complicated, but is (presumably) designed the way it is to accomidate for Convocation of the Damned: Shift-right click your Alchemic Router in the Air to clear prior connections. Next shift-right click the Alchemic Calcinator with the Router to bind it to the type of reagent that is contained within the Calcinator. Yes, this is a required step. Once the Alchemic Router is attuned to the right reagent simply right-click the Alchemic Calcinator to bind it as the sender, and right-click your Master Ritual Stone (or Belljar) to set it as the receiver. Afterwards remember to Shift-right click the air again to clear previously bound locations. If you get a message saying "Linked Container has no connection remaining!" you likely forgot this step

For reference, the best reagent to boost your Mark of the Falling Tower ritual with is Orbis Terrae, for +2 radius to the summoned meteor. Other modifiers do exist, but won't make meteors any bigger/richer than Orbis Terrae (or stack with it)

Blood Money, or "external LP network storage in item form"

With a T3 altar you're able to craft an item added by Blood Arsenal called Blood Money, which can than be compressed into 4x, 16x and 64x versions of itself. The way it works is simple: Right click to consume the item, and it'll add 10K per sheet (meaning 10K, 40K, 160K or 640K depending on compression level) of LP to your network. The reason it's worth mentioning? It adds this LP to your network instantly. If your LP network is already full, but your WoS is still producing LP, you can craft it into Blood Money rather than letting that extra generation go to waste, and stock up for when you want to start summoning meteors. Than you can burn through your external stock of LP to quickly refill the network again, maybe for more meteors

You'll have to balance LP generation with crafting speed, and keeping your LP network topped off so your WoS doesn't drain the network and stop working, but beyond that you can store effectively infinite LP outside your actual LP network

## Optimizing blood flow (T5, T6, WAs)

Externally storing LP is all well and good, but if you're not producing it efficienctly you're not going to get much use out of that. So what's the optimal setup for producing LP once you're able to put together a WoS ritual (and, with it, a T5 altar)?

First off, lets start with a few rules. First, as of 2.7 you cannot use a World Accelerator to boost the speed at which a WoS ritual produces LP, although you can still WA a Blood Atlar to absolutely negate the need for any speed runes. Second, Blood Orbs draining LP from an altar to fill your LP network will inherently consume LP much faster than items being crafted will consume LP. Keep this in mind if you are not using WAs (balancing sacrifice/speed runes) or if you are using WAs (if you're producing more LP than an Orb can consume you cannot run out of LP doing crafting in the same altar). Third, remember that Blood Altars have limited capacity, and especially when using WA cheese you can easily exceed the amount of LP an altar can store with how much a WoS ritual is producing per WoS tick

Since I don't understand the math behind LP production/consumption speed at all I'm afraid all I can offer is the best answer I found while testing: For a T5 blood altar 16 Orb, 2 Augmented Capacity, 43 Sacrifice and 47 Speed Runes will produce and consume 15400 LP per WoS tick (which is roughly every 25 ticks, as far as I can guess from rough ingame testing). Alternatively, with an HV WA speeding up the Blood Altar, a 16 Orb, 6 Augmented Capacity, 86 Sacrifice Runes setup will produce/consume 28300 LP per WoS tick. About another altar worth for 6A HV. Very Balanced(TM), indeed

For crafting items, 30 Runes of Sacrifice/60 Speed Runes seems to keep up with crafting without draining more LP than is being generated. Transvector Dislocators can be used to swap the relevant row of runes with the press of a button. Notice how the crafting and non-WA setup basically switch around one T5 line of runes between speed and sacrifice runes? Rest assured, that's not a coincidence

For T6 altars you've got basically three choices - use individual altars with their own WoS ritual, use redstone (or similar) control to have one altar do everything, or set up a dedicated LP generation altar that feeds other altars (be it for crafting or for keeping your LP network full). I can't say any of these are the clearly superior option to any other, but for what it's worth I've personally always went with the last one. The main reason being that, particularly for modpacks, it's the most flexible. In addition you can wallshare blood altars, so the cost of building multiple altars will be mitigated a fair bit

For designing such a T6 altar setup: 19 Acceleration, 11 Augmented Capacity, 12 Dislocation and 142 Sacrifice Runes produces and extracts a steady 45100 LP per WoS tick, or about 1804 LP/t. On the flipside an altar with 19 Acceleration, 12 Dislocation, 5 Augmented Capacity and 48 Speed Runes can consume the full amount of LP being generated when it's being put it into your LP network, leaving space for up to 100 other runes (this can be Orb runes to increase the capacity of your LP network, more Speed runes to increase item crafting speed on the altar, or a combination of both). If for some truly incomprehensible reason this is not enough space for runes you can use WAs to reduce (LV-HV) or remove (EV+) the need for speed runes entirely when filling the blood orb, gaining another 48 rune slots at the cost of 6A EV for a total of 148 open slots. To do what with? Who knows

As for the WA version of the T6 double(+) altar setup, well, that one ran into a snag during testing. WAs are very effective as extarnal speed runes at the cost of a rounding error worth of passive power consumption, but you might have noticed that the generation altar doesn't use any speed runes at all. I have tried to figure out an LP generation altar setup using WAs, but even with 4x EV WAs I was only able to increase production rate to 46300 LP per WoS tick - About ~2.66% better, for 49152 EU/t. If there's some strategy I missed in testing, oops. Otherwise it seems this is the end of the WA line

Early(?) Blood Shards The way that Bound Blades work in terms of gathering Weak Blood Shards is that they apply a Weakness IV debuff to an enemy, and killing an enemy with that debuff has a chance to drop a Weak Blood Shard. Looting applies to the drop chance If you find that you're not getting any Weak Blood Shards try fighting enemies that are able to survive at least one swing of the blade. Otherwise the enemy might technically die before the debuf is factored in, meaning no chance for a blood shard drop

There do exist two other ways to apply Weakness IV debufs to enemies, which will give you a chance to get weak blood shards even without a Bound Blade. Thaumcraft Pech's Curse foci are able to inflict a number of possible debuffs, one of which is Weakness. Enhancing the foci to Potency IV is required to get Weakness IV, and after that a final Nightshade upgrade can take the RNG out of getting the right debuf to land. Alternatively Witchery is able to brew spash potions of Weakness IV using it's complex brewing system, which will require an Attunted Stone (Charged) per (batch of) brews. It's also recommended to buff the brew's duration if you're worried about it running out, and definitely the extent to make it easier to land on large groups For reference, the complex brew recipe, in order, is: Nether Wart, Fermented Spider Eye, Glowstone Dust, Blaze Rod, Attuned Stone (Charged), Redstone Dust, Obsidian, Blaze Powder, Wood Ash, Cocoa Beans, Gunpowder

How many Runes of the Orb? The minimum number of required Runes of the Orb to finish BM progression is 13, to reach the 15M LP requirement to start Convocation of the Damned with the T5 orb you're limited to without a better altar. Which, in turn, requires the Convocation. That said there's another ritual that requires copious amounts of LP, possibly more than your orb can hold: Mark of the Falling Tower. Runes of the Orb can put you within reach of meteors you'd otherwise not have enough LP for, or provide some much needed buffer in case a meteor summoning would completely drain your entire LP network dry - a very risky prospect when you've got other rituals (WoS) running, and possibly other things consuming LP from your LP network

Runes of the Orb and Mark of the Falling Tower are both technically available with only a T4 blood altar, but to activate a Mark of the Falling Tower ritual you need an Awakened Activation Crystal. This requires a Demon Blood Shard, which is frankly the only real thing gating a T5 Blood Orb, as the T5 altar itself is basically free once you have a T4 altar in place. As such I won't be listing numbers for the T4 orb, since by the time you can make use of it you should be able to craft a T5 orb already

| Blood Orb: |  |  |  | Archmage Blood Orb (T5) |  | Transcendent Blood Orb (T6) |  | Eldritch Blood Orb (T7?) |  | Note: |  |  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| LP capacity | LP capacity bonus per Orb rune |  |  |  | 10M | 400K | 30M | 1.2M | 80M | 3.2M | Having enough LP and being able to craft the item needed to summon a meteor are separate |  |  |

things, but it's possible you neglected BM progression for a while to focus on tech progression

| Meteor LP Cost | number of Runes of the Orb needed to summon the meteor |  |  |  | 12.5M | 7 | 44M | 12 | 90M | 4 |  |  |  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|  |  |  |  | 15M | 13 | 50M | 17 | 100M | 7 | Not all possible meteors are listed, since they were deemed too impractical to merit mention |  |  |
|  |  |  |  | 25M | 38 | 80M | 42 | 125M | 15 |  |  |  |

Note that this only lists the minimum amount of Runes of the Orb to summon a given meteor. You might have a setup that calls for rapidly chain-summoning cheaper meteors, leaving you wanting more LP storage. How many you want is up to you

## Misc Meteor tips

You're probably tempted to place the Master Ritual Stone of a Mark of the Falling Tower ritual in the middle of a chunk. If you're using Ore Drilling Rigs/Multiblock Miners to mine out meteors, however, it's better to place the Master Ritual Stone in the corner of a chunk border. This way the second largest meteor you can summon (Advanced Mass Fabricator II using Orbis Terrae) will fit neatly within a 4x4 chunk area. Divide these up into four 2x2 blocks, and you can use four Multiblock Miners set to a 16 block range (and replace with cobble false) to mine almost all meteors quickly and efficiently. You will need to place the MBMs such that they will snap to the right chunk corner and properly divide the meteor, as well as figure out drilling fluid/item output/mining pipes/etc, but the latter shouldn't be too hard a problem to solve. The former is most definitely not a mistake I've ever made. Nope. Totally not

"Four MBMs sounds like overkill"? Maybe. The second biggest meteor you can summon will take somewhere north of 6.5 hours to mine through using 4 T2 IV MBMs. Smaller meteors will be mined much faster, of course, but either way you'll have to balance investment into miners and mining speed (Note that MBMs will switch themselves off when they run out of things to mine. If new things to mine appear, however, you need only turn them on again to reuse them. No need to break the controller and redo maintenance, just turn them back on)

Concerned about breaking the meteor stopper block when summoning meteors that leave random stones to clean up afterwards? Use a Warding Focus to Ward the stopper block, and Bound Pickaxe/complex mining spell/etc. won't break it anymore. The same can be used to stop MBMs, BTW

## Spell of the diligent Tinkerer

The Spell of the diligent Tinkerer is a recently added (as far as I'm aware?) ritual that adds a modifier slot to Tinker's tools. The ritual requires Dusk runes to set up, and consumes 100K LP per tool. Each tool can only go through the ritual once The actual value of adding a modifier slot to TiC tools when you've got access to Tungstensteel (needed for the T4 orb) is sadly questionable, but in stark contrast to the TC infusion method of adding +1 modifier the BM ritual at least works

## Meteors Catalyst

| Melon | 123456 | 8 | Yes | All 16 different colors of Stained Glass. If that sounds like a beta test thing that was kept in the final game despite being completely useless in practice, well, I've got suspicions about that... |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Emitter (LV) | 300000 | 16 | Yes | Various pre-space ores. There's better meteors for basically everything this one yields, but if you're desperate for a cheap injection of Tantalite and/or Copper Ore this is an option |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Sensor (LV) | 300000 | 18 | Yes | Second (technically third, but who cares about the actual first) verse, same as the first we actually care about. If you're desperate for cheap Oilsand for some incomprehensible reason, this is your meteor |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Exquisite Diamond | 420000 | 13 | Yes | Enormous quantities of Graphite, lots of Coal and a non-zero amount of Diamond. Graphite goes into IV motors, T2 and T3 fusion coils, ASMD Capacitors, and maybe Space elevator? In any case it's worth having |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| End Stone | 500000 | 12 | Yes | Various HEE ores. Truthfully I've no idea how hard these are to find normally or how useful they are, but this is one way to get Stardust Ore for a Stardust bee |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Firestone Lens | 500000 | 12 | Yes | Various gemstone ores, including Vinteum (not that that's really useful in GTNH seeing the lack of Ars Magicka). A reasonable convenient grab bag of random stuff, but per usual it's hard to tell how useful gems are |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Sensor (HV) | 500000 | 13 | No | Various T1/T2 ores. A cheap source of Bastnasite, Molybdenum, Neodymiun and Barite ores, and the only meteor source of Electrotine, Bismuth and Antimony ores |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Alloy Ingot T1 | 500000 | 20 | Yes | A giant ball of Moon Rock, with less (though still a lot of) Moon Dirt and Moon Turf. Want to decorate your base with moon stones in a Rocketless challenge, or get Moon Rock for it's TC aspects? Well here you go |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Field Generator (LV) | 600000 | 20 | No | Various pre-space ores. Good for Mica ore and the only meteor that contains Sodalite ore (for however little that's worth) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cheese | 650000 | 15 | Yes | The only meteor with Cassiterite Sand, Fullers Earth, Diatomine and Cheese Ore, and a good source of Garnet, Garnetic Mineral and Basaltic Mineral Sand. An oddball, but it has it's uses |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nether Star | 750000 | 9 | No | The only meteor with Rutile ore, but I'm hoping that you're not desperately short on Rutile by the time you're summoning meteors. Doesn't have anything else to really recommend it |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Alloy Ingot T2 | 750000 | 20 | Yes | A giant ball of various Mars, Deimos and Phobos rocks. If you want it for decoration or some other reason in a Rocketless run, here you go |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| TNT | 775000 | 20 | Yes | A giant ball of Marble, Basalt, Black Granite and Red Granite. If you are building with those stones the meteor to summon thousands more is actually really convenient, but otherwise it's of limited use |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Sanitizing Soap | 800000 | 15 | Yes | The only source of Amber, the six TC Shard, Shadow Iron, Infused Gold, and Shadow Metal ores. Great if you got caught off-guard by Energy Crystal and/or Arcanite, and Shadow Iron otherwise needs a T5 rocket |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Alloy Ingot T3 | 1000000 | 20 | Yes | The only source of Callisto Ice, Ledox, Alduorite ores, the best source of Uvarovite Ore, and a cheap source of Chrome and Iridium ore. Not useless, but it's biggest selling point is the Callisto Ice and Ledox |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Field Generator (HV) | 1000000 | 18 | Yes | The only source of Tricalcium Phosphate, and the best source of Apatite, Pyrochlore and Tantalite Ore. If you ever needed a big ball version of an Apatite vein and/or Tantalite, here you go |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Plate | 1000000 | 20 | Yes | Various T3 planet stones. Again, if you want to build with them in Rocketless, here you go. Note: This is the T3 plate. The vanilla Galacticraft heavy duty plates don't have their tier in their name, but their tooltip |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Replicator | 1200000 | 18 | No | Random assortment of basic Nether ores. A good meteor given that these Nether versions of ores do get double yield from overworld counterparts, but aside from that mainly notable as the only meteor with Firestone |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Field Generator (IV) | 1500000 | 16 | Yes | Various T3 ores, alongside an exclusive Adamantium Ore normally restricted to T6+ veins, exclusive Ardite Ore normally restricted to T4+ veins, and Deep Iron (T4 small, T5+ veins) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Assembling Machine III | 2000000 | 9 | No | End versions of Galena, Lead, Silver and Cryolite. Cheap Galena and the only source of Cryolite, otherwise not noteworthy |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Emitter (HV) | 2000000 | 16 | No | A big ball of various Moon ores. Relatively cheap, but unless you're tight on LP - in which case why are you summoning meteors at all - does nothing the Advanced Mass Fabricator II meteor doesn't do better |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Mass Fabricator IV | 2500000 | 12 | No | A ball of various Endstone versions of Thorium, Uranium and a few (very sparse) Plutonium ores. Honestly not sure what this meteor does that a Staballoy Golem EEC can't, TBH |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Circuit Assembler II | 3250000 | 18 | Yes | Big ball of endstone variants of a random mishmash of various pre-space to T3-ish ores. Only source of Pentlandite, Magnetite, Garnierite, Bentonite, Magnesite, Glauconite, Wulfenite, Molybdenite and Powellite Ores |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Soul Sand | 5000000 | 16 | Yes | Soul Sand. Yes, that's it, just Soul Sand. Need a lot of Soul Sand in Garden of Grind? Well there's one way to get it...I guess |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Mass Fabricator II | 6000000 | 24 | No | A giant ball of various T1 and T2 ores. Most noteworthy for being the best meteor source of (the materials needed to produce) Titanium, Tungsten, as well as Indium |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Pufferfish | 6666666 | 16 | Yes | You ever looked at something and went "I feel like the devs only added this because they thought it was funny"? If so you'll know how I feel about this meteor. That said it is the only meteor source of Saltpeter Ore |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Plate Tier 4 | 7500000 | 20 | Yes | Various T4 planet stones, you know the drill by now |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Boxinator | 10000000 | 18 | No | Big ball of various Bartworks ores from Ross128b. Remember when you went to Ross128b to grab non-Roquesite ores, before realizing Roquesite is garbage? Yeah, me neither. Not sure what this meteor is good for |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Plate Tier 5 | 10000000 | 20 | Yes | As before, but T5 planet stones |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Scanner IV | 12500000 | 14 | No | Big ball of various platline-related ores. Does require a platline to fully process, but shove this meteor through a platline and you'll be swimming in everything from Rhodium to Osmium. Highly recommend |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Plate Tier 6 | 15000000 | 20 | Yes | As before, but T6 planet stones. Actually all T6 planets are moons, so T6 moon stones? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Crystalprocessor Mainframe | 25000000 | 16 | No | Regular Tiberium ore, as well as Endstone versions of Naquadah, Enriched Naquadah, and Naquadria. Probably goes without saying, but if you're going to be diving into Naqfuel, this is a very useful meteor |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Plate Tier 7 | 30000000 | 20 | Yes | As before, but T7 planet stones |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Elite Recycler | 44000000 | 16 | Yes | A giant ball of Enceladus Snow, and the Endstone version of Mysterious Crystal Dust. Do you ever feel like you're short ten thousand+ Mysterious Crystal, or are lacking the bee to produce it? This meteor solves that |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Wetware Supercomputer | 50000000 | 14 | No | The best source of endstone versions of Galena and Sphalerite, with bonus Lead, Silver, and a tiny trace of Indium. If you want more Indium at this stage you should be spamming the Advanced Mass Fabricator II one |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Heavy Duty Plate Tier 8 | 50000000 | 20 | Yes | I trust you know how this goes by now |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Circuit Assembler VI | 80000000 | 16 | No | A big ball of a dozen-odd materials otherwise obtained from Rare Earth (I, II and III) as well as some more advanced chemical lines. This meteor contains more exclusive than non-exclusive ores, so worth checking out |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bloody Ichorium Fusion Casing | 90000000 | 32 | No | A gigantic ball of Endstone gem-type ores, from diamond to blue topaz to mysterious crystal to TC shards to Nether Stars. Blindsighted by gems in random recipes? This meteor should solve those problems. Forever |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Elite Mass Fabricator II | 100000000 | 22 | No | A very large ball of mostly T3-ish tier materials, though mainly a pre-UV source of the Endstone version of Cosmic Neutronium ore. Also the only meteor that contains Borax Ore if you still need a source of that |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Advanced Crop Synthesiser VII | 125000000 | 18 | No | A sizeable ball of various Endstone versions of precious materials, though the only one that really stands out given the catalyst it requires is a healthy amount of Infinity Catalyst ore |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Ion Thruster Jet | 1000000001 | 16 | No | Need Raw Tengam Ore in Rocketless? Well I hope you've got a very good LP supply and a lot of Iron Thruster Jets. Also contains enough salt to bury half a solar system, so good news for your cheese factory I guess |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Space Mining Module MK-III | 1000000001 | 16 | No | As the one above, but replace Raw Tengam Ore with Tartarite Ore |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
