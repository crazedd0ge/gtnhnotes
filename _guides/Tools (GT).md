| Adamantium Alloy | 10240000.0 | 5.0 | 191.2 | Naquadah Line, HSS-S Coils |  | Higher range can detect more veins at once (1×1=1 5×5=9 11×11=25 17×17=49, etc.) and has a higher chance of detecting veins successfully, but also suffers more damage per use |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Stellar Alloy | 1024000.0 | 7.0 | 96.0 | Naquadah Coils |  | (used on the edge of a 3x3 ore field you can scan the neighbouring three ore fields as well if your prospector's scanner has greater than 1x1 range) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Trinium | 5120000.0 | 8.0 | 128.0 | Deep Iron Ore |  | Note that ore veins will be added to Journeymap's Visual Prospecting layer even if prospecting fails. This does not apply to fluid fields prospected by scanning bedrock |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Extremely Unstable Naqquadah | 3150000.0 | 25.0 | 225.0 | ZPM EBF |  | Basic scanners take 3/15 damage per failed/successfully prospected chunk. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| MAR-Ce-M200 Steel | 20480000.0 | 4.0 | 150.0 |  |  | The (rough) number of uses is calculated as the durability divided by the average damage taken per use based on a scanner's range and success rate |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Tips and tricks: Some GT tools (see: Screwdriver) are never used to mine blocks, so mining speed is a useless stat for them. Other tools (see: Wrench) are used to break things frequently, so their mining speed actually matters. Keep this in mind before crafting/accepting a Vanadiumsteel Wrench as a (trap) quest reward That said if you choose to use a Tool Box to solve maintenance issues, rather than mass-producing duct tape or a Maintenance focus, you can easily use a Vanadiumsteel wrench (and it's massive durability) purely for maintenance work Electric GT tools get a durability multiplier (×1 for LV, ×2 for MV, ×4 for HV) and a speed multiplier (×2 for LV, ×3 for MV, ×4 for HV). Electric tools also last a lot longer due to not taking durability damage on every use, assuming they are kept charged with power. Invest in electric tools where possible
