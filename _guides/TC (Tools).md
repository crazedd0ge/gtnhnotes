|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Warding (Architect) | --------------------------------- | Gain fine(r) control over the focus' range |

Overchanting, Disenchanting, Mana Enchanting, Limit Break Enchanting. Or "the cheese was good, the service was abysmal"

Thaumic Bases adds a block called the Overchanter, able to improve the level of enchants on items. This overchanting can push enchants beyond their normal limits (I.E. Looting III -> Looting IV), but there's a catch - each individual item can have an enchant overchanted only once, regardless of the enchant's level. To explain how this block works, since while it is explained in full in the Thaumonomicon it's also not exactly intuitive: Place the item you want to Overchant in the single inventory space the block has. Double-right click the table with a wand to activate it. It'll draw 32 Praecantatio Essentia from a nearby jar (or similar source) and drain 30 levels from a nearby player. The Overchanter works from top to bottom, skipping any enchants already Overchanted on that particular item. It will overchant I.E. Silk Touch to Silk Touch II, though this doesn't have any effect bar looking funny on the tooltip (and maybe making anvil repairs more expensive, but even if that's relevant it's not relevant to a Void Metal Anvil, so there you go). This process does work on "enchantments" like the ones on TiC tools, so you can get a Looting IV/Fortune IV weapon/tool if you really wish.

Draconic Evolution adds the Disenchanter, which is able to strip enchantments off of items and put them into books. This damages the item unless the Disenchanter is sufficiently boosted in the same way a regular Enchantment Table is, up to and including being able to be boosted by I.E. Mana Pylons. Disenchanting keeps the level of the book's enchant, even if it exceeds the normal level limit of a given enchant.

Finally, Botania adds the Mana Enchanter, a multiblock structure - look in your Lexica Botania for how to build it, the block itself does not have a regular crafting recipe. You'll find it under Natural Apparatus -> Enchanting with Mana - that enchants unenchanted items using Mana. Enchanted books are used to determine which enchants should be added to an item, and while this process has an increasingly larger Mana cost the higher level (and more) enchants are added the process does not check whether the level of enchants on the books exceed normal limits. The books are not consumed in the process, for the record.

Put all three together and you have a system that lets you put higher than normal level enchants on a new item, Overchant them, strip the now higher enchantment onto a book, use the book to enchant a new item, Overchant the new item, etc. I'm not aware of any limit to this process bar excessive Mana costs

Unfortunately while the cheese is good, the service is abysmal. I have yet to find a practical use for this little trick, since basically everything that could benefit from crazy high enchants either is hardcoded to not beneift (see: Extreme Entity Crushers, hard limited to Looting IV) or is so incredibly impractical so as to not be useful (see: Terra Shatterer applying Fortune Yes to small ores...when you could just be throwing down more automated miners and collecting more resources automatically that way). As a final nail in the coffin Diamond Spikes - for reasons I don't understand - cannot be mana enchanted at all. And anvils of all stripes do respect enchantment level limits, so trying to apply Looting Yes to a diamond spike will just result in Looting III. They can be overenchanted, so Looting IV is possible, but Looting V and beyond require even greater shenaniganry.

Said shenaniganry does, however, exist, in the silliest way possible. Simply place and break a diamond spike in the world, and it's Overchanting NBT tag - the bit of data that tells the Overchanter this particular enchant on this particular item has already been Overchanted, and thus cannot be Overchanted again - will be deleted. This allows you to Overchant the Diamond Spike again, and again, and again, until you've got as high a level of Sharpness/Wrath/Looting/Whatever as you can put on it without going insane. Or running out of Praecantatio/experience, because that cost does add up quite fast if you're not paying attention

So, in what situation is it worth to do this? Truthfully, I'm not sure. This is not a small setup, and while you can make very silly mob farms with this technique the question has to be asked whether you're not better off with an EEC and just getting stuff in automatically, consistently, without the shenanigans that in world mob farms can bring with them. Would be a shame if you ended up tanking your FPS because you forgot some overflow pipe and tons of item/xp orb entities turned into a massive lag source, for example. All the same, if you want to experiment with this and see if you can figure out some kind of good use, go for it

For my part I've figured out two pieces of advice worth mentioning. One, remember that the Overchanter works top to bottom, so put whatever enchant you want raised to the stratosphere on top. A Sharpness/Wrath/Looting spike will need to Overchant Sharpness and Wrath before being able to Overchant Looting, while you probably have enough pointy pokey power sometime before, what, Sharpness/Wrath XX or what have you. Two, take a close look at what all enchantments are available, because various TC add-ons have added many not present in vanilla. One worth mentioning is Educational, which conflicts with Looting, but will increase the amount of experience dropped by mobs. Is there a meaningful use for tons and tons of experience in GTNH? Bar Overchanting itself, not sure. Perhaps challenge runs will have more use for it, but all the same it's one example of how you can go beyond simple Looting in terms of shenaniganry

Seroconverter Essentia 8x Perfodio 8x Fames 8x Messis 8x Corpus 8x Auram 8x Motus 8x Victus 8x Lucrum 8x Iter 8x Tutamen

## 8x Telum

The Seroconverter is a Thaumic Horizons device that allows a thaumaturge to take blood samples, infuse them with Essentia, and inject them to produce effects Splash potion versions of harmful effects are available, although in GTNH it's generally more useful to instantly delete an enemy with a TiC Crossbow rather than messing with status effects or damage over time nonsense For reference, the lightning bolt effect under Tempestas is Static Shock. When active it'll zap any nearby mob for minimal damage. Cool looking, perhaps thematic, though ultimately none too useful

Notes: [1] Item Vacuum is an item magnet effect. Does nothing an Item Dislocator doesn't, although Item Vacuum III does have a 15 block range if that matters [2] Vis Generation causes the player to emit Vis Orbs like dying mobs or Vis Shrooms being harvested. It's not useful to carry a series of arcane crafts, but useful for slowly topping up on the go

Tips and tricks: If you are going to do the Witchery Spirit Dimension note that any buffs that are active before drinking the Sleeping Potion will continue to be active in the Spirit World. You need this to get Night Vision in a nightmare, but Speed/Jump Boost and Saturation can also be of some use Saturation III is able to completely negate the Hunger effect you get from picking up filled GT tanks, or from the Unnatural Hunger Warp effect. Fames shots will save you a lot of fiddling with a Healing Axe if you're moving a ton of filled GT tanks within a (relatively) short time span

Mirror Magic, or "pre-Moon (discount) Ender Chest/Pouch, and interdimensional Wireless AE2 Terminal"

With Ender Chests/Pouches gated behind IV lootbags (or IV components, but mostly lootbags) you might be wanting for earlier interdimensional item transportation. Thaumcraft has the solution for you, in the form of Magic Mirrors. Of course it has complications, but some untapped potential as well To start with Magic Mirrors require Arcane Infusion as well as Vibrant Alloy plates, which requires Nichrome EBF coils and a Vacuum Freezer. EBF coils you should be upgrading ASAP anyway, and Nichrome itself requires a Vacuum Freezer, so catch up if you're behind on that bit of tech progression

Once you've crafted a set of Magic Mirrors how to put them to work? You can pump items in slowly with a hopper, or much faster via EnderIO conduit. On the output side an EnderIO Vacuum Chest or TC Hungry Chest can collect the dropped items. A hopper just isn't fast enough on the output side Of course lugging a magic mirror/hopper around is inconvenient. Craft a Magic Hand Mirror to send items to a linked mirror manually, or a Hungry Hand Mirror to automatically send whitelisted items. Set Runic Whitelist to "* Ore" and "Impure * Dust", sans quotes but with the spaces, for mining trips After setting up a pair of mirrors you might be disappointed to find that their item throughput can slow down to a crawl. This throughput issue can be completely removed by feeding either of the two mirrors Ordo Centi-Vis. Just 1 Ordo Centi-Vis is enough, so a dirt cheap throwaway node will do fine Another caveat is that Magic Mirrors link in pairs, which makes setting up a central collection point impractical. Melding Mirrors are the solution, able to link to an active Magic Mirror and send items to it. Give the output mirror Ordo, and you can have many miners send their bounty straight back home

What about sending fluid, though? Magic Mirrors only work with items, but cells/super tanks of fluids count as items, so they'll be send through magic mirrors just fine. Remember that you can pipe cells/super tanks into super tanks to automatically fill/empty them, and they can be renamed for filtering

So now you have ways to automatically send (specified) items to a central collection point, and a way to manually send other items to the same easily. But what about sending items to you? Is it possible to set up a system to send items to you interdimensionally, on command? As a matter of fact, yes This setup is going to require some Logistics Pipes. You're going to need Compressed Chests, Basic Logistics Pipes, and Provider Logistics Pipes (Mk1 or Mk2). In addition you'll need a Remote Orderer, a Remote Orderer Logistics Pipe, and a Logistics Power Junction. A solar panel is recommended The Logistics Power Junction acts like an AE2 Energy Acceptor, taking in power to feed the network. Unlike AE2 LP has no passive power drain, so a half-decent solar panel and power buffer will suffice. Note that pipes cannot connect to the top or the bottom of the LPJ, it must be one of the sides Place the Remote Orderer Logistics Pipe against a Compressed Chest which feeds into a magic mirror. Link your Remote Orderer item to it by right-clicking on the RO pipe. Create a small LP network with Provider Pipes attached to Compressed Chests, although not the chest connected to the RO pipe Carry around a Magic Mirror linked to the one attached to the RO Compressed Chest. Whenever you want to request items from your LP network place the mirror somewhere in-world, and use your Remote Orderer item to request items. They'll be send to the chest, through the mirror, and into your hand

Getting discount Ender Chests and discount wireless AE2 pre-Moon is nice and all, but exactly how long is this system going to be useful? You'll be switching over to AE2 digital storage soon enough, post-Moon probably, so what are you supposed to do with all this LP stuff? Spam Storage Busses? What you need is an AE2 Interface. Yes, just one bog standard AE2 Interface. Attach a Provider Pipe against the Interface (a Mk2 pipe isn't needed, but recommended in this case), and your fledgeling LP network will read your entire AE2 network's inventory, including Drives and Storage Busses From there you can continue to use the rest of the system as-is - the Remote Orderer pipe into Compressed Chest into Magic Mirror, the Remote Orderer Item and the LPJ all remain unchanged. The only difference is that instead of many chests and pipes you've got one pipe and digital storage system Of course this system isn't a long term replacement - there's extra steps involved and you'll never get a wireless crafting terminal or wireless Energistics through LP. What it is is cheap - Wireless Access Points drain a non-zero amount of passive power, and Quantum Rings? Passive 990 EU/t per ring

Realistically you can expect this system to fall off in IV at the earliest. Then the power cost of quanum rings isn't too crazy, and a Random Things Spectre Key gives you access to a personal dimension from anywhere. Set up a Quantum Ring in there, and you'll have good access to your AE2 network

Planar Gateways, or "How to get from point A/B/C/D to my own personal pocket dimension and back"

Planar Gateways, part of Thaumic Horizon's Rift branch of research, is a method of creating custom (to a point) pocket dimensions which support up to four two-way Planar Gateways that teleports the player interdimensionally. Setting this up requires the ability to smelt Enderium, and a Primordial Pearl Also required is at absolute bare minimum a Gold Banded Greatwood Scepter, but for the love of the unspeakable Eldritch beings waiting to eat your face off don't attempt this with just that tier of wand. A Gold Banded Transmutative Scepter (or better) at least is highly recommended Some way to deal with Warp will also be needed, as this branch of research needs Void Metal to even begin and every required research along the branch is some level of Warp-y. A Soul Brazier setup would be best, as you need Advanced Alchemical Constructs anyway. Craft a batch of them, say 24

Once you've got what you need to set it up it's time to gather the materials. You'll need one Node Stabilizer (regular will do, Advanced is a waste of resources in this case), a Node Transductor, four Transduction Amplifiers, and six Vortex Attenuators. Also prepare some PR Red Alloy Wire, it'll be handy Next choose a node to turn into your own personal pocket dimension. Depending on the aspects present in the node the pocket dimension will have different blocks it's made up of, properties, etc. If you want the simplest, most basic pocket dimension look for a weak node with Terra (and maybe Ordo)

With everything prepared make a backup before setting things up, because this process is very prone to mistakes which cause things to explode violently. Take the fact that success involves a series of contained violent explosions as a measure of how volatile this process is Place the node in the centre block of the chunk you want it placed in, making sure there's 7-12 blocks worth of space in all six directions around the node. It's best to prepare to keep it there long-term, though it's not strictly necessary once you've got one Planar Gateway set up (and secured) Place a line of 6 (if only the chunk with the node is loaded) or 9 (if the node is in the centre of a 3×3 of loaded chunks) blocks against all six sides of the node. On the seventh or tenth block place a Vortex Attenuator facing the node. Give the Attenuator a Redstone signal with a redstone block (the redstone block is because, as said, violent explosions are about to happen, and redstone blocks have a better Blast Resistance than levers or redstone torches. I'm not sure how powerful the explosion is, but it can break blocks with no blast resistance at range) At this point place the node stabilizer and node transductor, and give the latter a redstone signal to turn your node into an energized node. This will block the top and bottom Vortex Attenuators, but don't worry. Violent explosions will take care of that problem in short order. Once the node is energized you can place the four Transuctor Amplifiers agains the four sides of the energized node. Now comes a tricky part: Lay down some Project Red Red Alloy Wire so you can send a redstone signal to all the Amplifiers without giving the Node Stabilizer below a redstone signal When all this is done activate the Amplifiers by giving them a redstone signal and flee, because violent explosions are about to happen. If all goes well your Vortex Attenuators and Redstone Blocks (both have a fair bit of Blast Resistance, so they should be fine) will survive the blast, and contain the Rift

Before turning this Rift into a pocket dimension you might wish to do some Rift crafting. The biggest item by far is the Disposable Crystalline Wand, which could allow you to do some very fancy stuff in terms of wand progression, or allow you to activate Planar Gateways if you lack a good wand/staff

Once you're done with Rift crafting grab a Primordial Pearl (you can give it a name with an Anvil to give your pocket dimension a custom name, if you wish) and throw it in the rift. After some more explosions, non-violent ones this time, the Rift will become a pocket dimension Walk into the Planar Vortex to enter your pocket dimension (hold/press a direction key while entering, since it'll spawn you right on top of the exit). You can right-click the Planar Vortex inside your pocket dimension to bind a Blank Planar Keystone to that pocket dimension Before making any Planar Gateways make sure to clear out the portal locations inside your pocket dimension, otherwise you might find yourself awkwardly stuck inside unbreakable portal blocks. The portal locations are the four "edges" of the sphere not on the top and bottom. Dig until the circle shrinks (more specifically: the four portals will not necessarily spawn in the centre of the Planar Bounry blocks located at the furthest x, -x, z and -z coords of your pocket dimension. So clear those edges until you see the circle of Planar Boundry blocks get smaller. This should, hopefully, be enough)

With all this done all that's left is to create a Planar Gateway somewhere in a dimension other than a pocket dimension or the Outer Lands. I also wouldn't recommend placing a Planar Gateway in the Witchery Spirit World and/or the Random Things Spectre Dimension. Doing so might cause issues As a final precaution, or in case my instructions on digging out the portal locations wasn't clear (my apoligies) bring an Excavation wand focus before heading through a Planar Gateway for the first time. In case there's blocks in the way an Exacation Focus can break the blocks you can't target otherwise

Thaumic Horizons Lenses, or "how to get Night Vision without lootbags a Cleanroom"

Illumine Lens Echo Lens Kirlian Lens Evanescent Lens

## Scholar's Lens

Thaumic Horizons Lenses are items you can add to Goggles of Revealing (or their variants, like Nano Goggles of Revealing) to give them added effects. Listed above are the different lenses that are available. Each requires a simple Arcane Infusion to craft. A Lens Case is available for convenient storage

Self Infusion, or "how to apply permanent buffs for the low, low cost of one horrible death. Also Primordial Pearl"

General Infusions: Quicksilver Limbs Awakened Blood

## Diamondflesh

Specific Infusions: Chameleon Skin Silverwood Heart Synthskin Amphibious Breath Morthic Fingers Spider Climb

## Warped Tumor

Self Infusion is the final milestone of Thaumic Horizons' Incarnation branch of research. Using it requires doing a fair bit of Warpy research as well as a Primodrial Pearl for the Soul Beacon, but otherwise nothing particularly challenging The process is honestly pretty well explained in the Thaumonomicon - build a Curative Vat, craft and revive a Corpse Effigy, infuse it with your desired infusions (though ensure the infusion is stable enough for the vessal to survive the infusions), and finally use a soul beacon to reincarnate into your enhanced self

Tips and tricks: As with regular creature infusions your reincantated body can have as many general infusions as you are able to manage (though note the same infusion can't be applied more than once), but only one specific infusion In case you have any Death Protection Poppets left over from any Witchery shenanigans you may wish to remove those from their Poppet Shelf before dying. Just, you know, friendly advice. I certainly didn't make that mistake before and was thoroughly confused how I survived a /kill. Nope, not me Given the presence of Healing Axes, Crafting wand foci and several jetpacks (or means to replicate their effects), as well as the lack of Oceans and Ocean Monuments, some specific infusions are very likely to be more useful than others

Magic Energy Converters/Absorbers, or "How to provide clean power remotely, possibly indefinitely"

Magic Energy Converters consume magically charged items to produce power, whereas Magic Energy Absorbers absorb either environmental or Essentia-based energy and convert that into power. Neither produces pollution, and both can be used to generate remote power either with highly dense or infinite fuel

Energy Converter Item Aer/Aqua/Terra Shard Order Shard Entropy/Ignis Shard Balance/other Shard [1] Fiery Tears [2] Notch Apple

## Nether Star

Notes: A full list of all valid fuels can be found in NEI. This just lists the highlights, and gives an idea of just how power dense some of these things are compared to, say, combustion fuels or Benzene [1] Includes the Forbidden Magic sin/Taint Shards and Tinkerer Nether/End Shards. Nether mob farms will generate Sloth Shards at a decent clip, given that the condition for those are mobs dying to environment damage, and being killed through I.E. Diamond Spikes counts as such [2] Fiery Tears are cheaper to produce (albeit exceptionally slowly) in an Assembling Machine than the amount of power they produce through a Magic Energy Converter. This is presumably a bug that'll probably get fixed eventually, but until that point...it's honestly not worth abusing. Just a curiosity really

Tips and tricks: Magic Energy Absorbers will also generate power using Creeper Eggs (not spawn eggs) instead of Dragon Eggs. Creeper Eggs can be found inside the Evolved Creeper Boss boss chamber in Mars dungeons. Creeper eggs will only produce HV power instead of Dragon Egg's EV, however

Ethereal Shard, or "How to Convert excess Centi-Vis/Essentia into Vis"

Ethereal Shards are a Thaumic Horizons curiosity which act like Vis batteries, effectively. To raise their storage capacity they have to be fed Ethereal Essense (a Golem with a Use Core can do this automatically), and to charge them they have to be fed Centi-Vis through an energized node or Essentia Dynamo Each piece of Ethereal Essense will raise the storage capacity for that essence's type of essentia by 4. Regrettably compound aspects are highly inefficient to useless here, because while they require the full amount of Centi-Vis to charge they will only provide a minimal amount of Vis back when drained To drain Vis from an Ethereal Shard simply use it like a node, or place a wand recharge pedestal within rage. It'll drain Vis to recharge the wand/item in question just like a node

In practice this is a very niche item. Proper Energized Nodes are available at exactly the same time, and they will recharge a wand for free, forever, without requiring a surplus of specific Ethereal Essence to even be able to even store any Vis with any degree of efficiency in the first place Nevertheless Ethereal Shards do have some uses. They can store excess Centi-Vis from energized nodes, and release this Vis to speed up a Wand Recharge Pedestal by giving it multiple points to draw from (both the Centi-Vis and the Shard). If you've got a really weak Energized Nodes this might help Ethereal Shards can also store Centi-Vis produced through an Essentia Dynamo, giving you a source of Vis through Essentia. This is, again, not great given the presence of Primal Shrooms and nodes not being that hard to move. But if you're sitting on useless jars full of junk it's one way to empty them

Ethereal Shards can also be used for decorative purposes, if the concept of a floating crystal with colored orbs circling around it appeals to you. But for it's actual intended use (which I have to admit I do find difficult to figure out) this is something you set up for the sake of it, not because it's worth doing

Metal Transmutation, or "How to convert time and sanity into rare(ish) resources"

Metal Transmutation is the act of using Essentia to turn one nugget into three, thus effectively duping the material at the cost of whatever you use to source the necessary Essentia

Notes: [1] These Transmutation recipes are found as individual researches on the Alchemy page. They're generally cheaper and easier to pull off than (not so) "perfected" variants, so it pays off to invest into researching these recipes over relying on the bulk package that is the Witching Gadgets' version [2] These recipes are found as a singular research in Witching Gadgets. They're more expensive than the ones in Alchemy, but it's only one research to unlock them all. Also yes, most of those metals are indeed unobtainable and/or worthless.
