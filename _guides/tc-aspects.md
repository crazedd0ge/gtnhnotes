# TC (Aspects)

| Aequalitas | Ethereal Essence [5] | Cognitio+Ordo | Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | Notes: |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| Aer | Rubber Sheet (from IC2) [11] | ------------------------ | Aer | 1.0 |  | [1] A cheap and basic source of Essentia for this Aspect, generally with an eye towards manual Crucible use. The number in parenthesis is the number of "junk" aspects the item contains |
| Alienis | Ender Pearl (10) | Vacuos+Tenebrae | Aer/Ignis/Perditio | 20.0 |  | [1] Cetain aspects are difficult/impossible to get outside of Ethereal Essence, so a Wisp mob farm eventually becomes necessary. Wisp Spawners can be found in the overworld/Nether(?) |
| Aqua | Fresh Water | ------------------------ | Aqua | 3.0 |  | [2] An aspect's component aspects. Rather than scanning an item with the aspect you can combine the component aspects in a Research Table to discover it, which is useful for Victus |
| Arbor | Stick | Aer+Herba | Aer/Aqua/Terra | 1.0 |  | [3] Which primal aspects an aspect will yield when a node is energized. Take note for later if you find a node with all six primals, as this will likely be used as your starter energized node |
| Astrum | Ethereal Essence [5] | Lux+Primordium | Aer/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio | 1.0 |  | [4] In a crucible Iron Nuggets often end up triggering a conflicting recipe. As such Rubber Nuggets (called Rubber Chips ingame) or Iron Bars are the preferred sources of pure Metallum |
| Auram | Aurelia Petals (1) [9] | Aer+Praecantatio | Aer/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio | 16.0 |  | [5] Aspects with no known items which contain their essentia type have to rely on Wisp mob farms to generate their flavor of Ethereal Essence. Terminus might as well be in this boat too |
| Bestia | String (1) | Motus+Victus | Aer/Aqua/Ordo/Terra | 6.0 |  | [6] If you're looking for additional/alternative sources: Calium (from electrolyzing Bonemeal), Magnesium (from Magnesite), Obsidian Ingot/Dust, and/or Briar Seed Bag |
| Caelum | Ender Pearl (10) | Vitreus+Metallum | Ordo/Terra | 1.0 |  | [6] Briar is a plant from Thaumic Bases. They respond weakly to fertilizer, taking up to a half stack to go from planted to mature, but drop up to three(?) Briar Seed Bags per harvest |
| Cognitio | Paper (3) | Ignis+Spiritus | Aqua/Ignis/Perditio/Terra | 2.0 |  | [7] From Thaumic Bases Rosa Mysteria grown on Tainted Crystal Blocks. Rosa Mysteria does respond to fertilizer, and better than Briar, but requires high light levels to grow |
| Corpus | Stock | Bestia+Mortuus | Aer/Aqua/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 2.0 |  | [7] Stable Vitium essentia also comes from Tainted Lands blown up with Alchemite, or dissolved through a Disintegration focus. Take care not to hit nodes with Alchemite, as they will die |
| Desidia | Bed (9) | Vinculum+Spiritus | Aer/Aqua/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | [8] Magic Logs come from Magic Trees, which are found in Mystic Grove biomes. Be sure to use planks for better Praecantatio yield |
| Electrum | Fine Iron Wire | Potentia+Machina | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 24.0 |  | [9] From Thaumic Bases Aurelia flowers, which generate petals when exposed to a full moon. Set some up where you pass by frequently early and stock up |
| Exanimis | Exhale of the Horned One (4) | Mortuus+Motus | Aer/Aqua/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 32.0 |  | [9] Note that Aurelia petals are randomly placed on grass/dirt blocks within a 9Ã—9 area centered around the plant, so make sure they've got plenty of space to actually generate petals |
| Fabrico | Crafting Table | Instrumentum+Humanus | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 2.0 |  | [10] Essentia Aspect-Value. This is used by Magic Energy Absorbers to determine how much EU a given essentia should produce when converted into power |
| Fames | Sugar | Victus+Vacuos | Aer/Aqua/Perditio/Terra | 2.0 |  | [11] As noted this refers to the Rubber Sheet item from IC2, crafted from six GT rubber sheets. Not GT rubber sheets directly, which instead contain Motus and Fabrico |
| Gelum | Snowball | Ignis+Perditio | Ignis/Perditio | 1.0 |  |  |
| Gloria | Ethereal Essence [5] | Humanus+Iter | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | Tips and tricks: |
| Gula | Cookie (1) | Fames+Vacuos | Aer/Aqua/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | Alumentum speeds up the rate an Alchemical Furnace empties it's essentia. Arcane Bellows only speed up the rate at which items are smelted into essentia |
| Herba | Seeds | Terra+Victus | Aqua/Terra | 2.0 |  | The Thaumium Alchemical Furnace from Thaumic Bases did not appear to work in testing in 2.2.3, but in 2.3.0 it has been tested to work and work well. Alumentum is required, but worth |
| Humanus | Rotten flesh (2) | Bestia+Cognitio | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 6.0 |  | The Aspect Library from Witching Gadgets makes it a lot easier to set lables to a specific essentia, as it doesn't require phials to work |
| Ignis | Sulfur Dust (1) | ------------------------ | Ignis | 3.0 |  |  |
| Infernus | Nether Brick (1) | Ignis+Praecantatio | Aer/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio | 1.0 |  |  |
| Instrumentum | Rubber Round | Humanus+Ordo | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 3.0 |  |  |
| Invidia | Redstone Comparator (4) | Fames+Sensus | Aer/Aqua/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | How to work Nodes (and make them work for you) |
| Ira | Fire Charge (2) | Ignis+Telum | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  |  |
| Iter | Track (1) | Motus+Terra | Aer/Ordo/Terra | 6.0 |  | Early on make sure to scan as many nodes as you can. They will be recorded on both journeymap and Node Tracker, allowing for convenient filtering/searching for specific nodes |
| Limus | Slimeball | Aqua+Victus | Aqua/Terra | 3.0 |  | Late game nodes essentially become another resource. A rare, difficult to move resource which can have any number of aspects contained...of which you'll often need specific ones |
| Lucrum | Gold Ingot (3) | Humanus+Fames | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 32.0 |  | Make seperate waypoints for any Hungry Nodes you encounter (they are exceedingly deadly), as well as any nodes that contain a compound aspect with all six primal aspects |
| Lux | Torch | Aer+Ignis | Aer/Ignis | 4.0 |  |  |
| Luxuria | Lead (5) | Corpus+Fames | Aer/Aqua/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | Once you've made a Gold Banded Greatwood Scepter you'll be able to start moving nodes, albeit using the normal method that has a very high chance of damaging nodes |
| Machina | Redstone Torch (1) | Instrumentum+Motus | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 16.0 |  | The advanced method is in Automagy, and requires a Gold Banded Transmutative Scepter and a Warding Focus. The focus will not be consumed crafting Warded Glass |
| Magneto | Magnetite Dust (3) | Metallum+Iter | Aer/Ordo/Terra | 24.0 |  | "Damaging" a node means turning Bright nodes into normal nodes, normal into Pale, Pale into Fading, and Fading nodes cannot be damaged further. They're useless enough as-is |
| Messis | Pumpkin | Herba+Humanus | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 3.0 |  | These traits are relevant as they determine both how quickly a node recharges Vis and how much Centi-Vis you'll get when energizing a node...although the later might not matter |
| Metallum | Iron Bars [4] | Terra+Vitrius | Ordo/Terra | 8.0 |  |  |
| Meto | Cobblestone Slab (2) | Instrumentum+Messis | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 4.0 |  | When energizing a node you will get Floor(Sqrt(Vis*Trait Modifier)) Centi-Vis from the highest source of a given Primal aspect. A node with Aqua and Victus will not add up the two |
| Mortuus | Bone Needle (2) | Perditio+Victus | Aqua/Perditio/Terra | 16.0 |  | A node's trait modifier is 1.2 if Bright, 1 if normal, 0.8 if Pale, and 0.5 if Fading. Note that due to the square root function and rouding damaging a node might not actually effect it |
| Motus | Tiny Plastic Fluid Pipe | Aer+Ordo | Aer/Ordo | 4.0 |  | (in example: A normal node with 35 Ignis will round down to 5 Centi-Vis. If the node is damaged and made pale it'll drop to effectively 28 Ignis, which still rounds down to 5 Centi-Vis) |
| Nebrisum | Platinum Metallic Powder Dust (3) | Perfodio+Lucrum | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 48.0 |  |  |
| Ordo | Chiselled Stone Bricks (1) | ------------------------ | Ordo | 8.0 |  | The end goal of manipulating nodes is, first, to craft a super powerful node that will very rapidly recharge your wand automatically. There's a few ways to go about this...eventually |
| Pannus | Carpet | Bestia+Instrumentum | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 6.0 |  | First off you're going to want to invest in a "starter" energized node, just to get some automated recharging and Foci enhancements going. It'll be slow, yes, but it'll be worth it |
| Perditio | Tiny Pile of Stone Dust | ------------------------ | Perditio | 2.0 |  | Once you've found a suitable node with all six primal aspects jar it, bring it back home, and energize it. Yes, it'll be relatively weak and slow, but it'll be better than nothing |
| Perfodio | Marble Dust (1) | Humanus+Terra | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 4.0 |  |  |
| Permutatio | Barley Seed (1) | Ordo+Perditio | Ordo/Perditio | 12.0 |  | So what are the ways you can grow a super node? |
| Potentia | Redstone (1) | Ignis+Ordo | Ignis/Ordo | 20.0 |  |  |
| Praecantatio | Magic Wood Planks (1) [8] | Potentia+Vacuos | Aer/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio | 16.0 |  | Node Bullying is the vanilla safe way of growing super nodes, but I really don't recommend using it. It's slower than molasses, very inefficient for growing huge nodes, and very expensive |
| Primordium | Ethereal Essence [5] | Motus+Vacuos | Aer/Ordo/Perditio | 1.0 |  | The idea is that nodes close together will eat each other, but the chance of growing an aspect is 1:(new aspect count). Of course this is modded. There's ways to improve this method |
| Radio | Thorium Dust (3) | Lux+Potentia | Aer/Ignis/Ordo | 48.0 |  |  |
| Sano | Fresh Milk [6] | Ordo+Victus | Aqua/Ordo/Terra | 24.0 |  | Node Linking is something added by Thaumic Bases, which only requires Arcane Infusion...though a Flux Scrubber wand focus (from the same mod) is highly recommended as well |
| Sensus | Rose Red | Aer+Spiritus | Aer/Aqua/Perditio/Terra | 4.0 |  | Linking two nodes together very quickly transfers ~70% of the aspects of the sender node to the receiver node. It's best to do this outside your base, since it will generate a ton of flux |
| Spiritus | Soul Sand (2) | Victus+Mortuus | Aqua/Perditio/Terra | 24.0 |  | (for the record, I have no idea what "supreme metal forged from both nether and end" refers to. You'd think Ichorium, but nothing I tried seemed to make a difference. Seems GTNH specific) |
| Strontio | Scrap | Cognitio+Perditio | Aqua/Ignis/Perditio/Terra | 64.0 |  |  |
| Superbia | Golden Sword (8) | Vacuos+Volatus | Aer/Ordo/Perditio | 1.0 |  | Hungry Node Feeding is the vanilla unsafe way. If you feed an item to a hungry node there's a chance it'll gain a relevant aspect. Feeding it a steady diet of crafting tables will grow it fast |
| Tabernus | Chain Boots (8) | Tutamen+Iter | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | Hungry nodes are very rare, however, and exceedingly dangerous/hard/annoying to energize...in vanilla. In GTNH you've got tools to resolve all of these issues |
| Telum | Wooden Sword (2) | Ignis+Instrumentum | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 6.0 |  | (the vanilla solution is to Taint the node, as that removes the Hungry trait, and energize it like that. This inevitably will generate taint in your base, which needs to be cleaned up afterwards) |
| Tempestas | Iron Fence (3) | Aer+Aqua | Aer/Aqua | 64.0 |  |  |
| Tempus | Redstone Repeater (7) | Ordo+Vacuos | Aer/Ordo/Perditio | 1.0 |  | The Node Manipulator from Thaumic Bases allows you to give a node the Hungry trait. This does require EV Sensors/Emitters, so not cheap, but it is a way to create a hungry node |
| Tenebrae | Abyssal Block Slab | Lux+Vacuos | Aer/Ignis/Perditio | 24.0 |  | The Vortex Attenuator from Thaumic Horizons can remotely "turn off" a node's Hungry trait while it's active, allowing it to be safely jarred and energized. This requires Void Metal |
| Terminus | Crystal Matrix Ingot (40) | Alienis+Lucrum | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | (note that this is only temporary, so make sure you have a Vortex Attenuator ready and active where you want to energize the node. Unless you enjoy organically grown holes in your base) |
| Terra | Dirt/Gravel | ------------------------ | Terra | 1.0 |  |  |
| Tutamen | Red Granite Dust (1) | Instrumentum+Terra | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 12.0 |  | Node Catalysts also exist, I guess, but go right ahead and forget they exist. And don't do the Taboo research for it unless you need to to unlock Ichorium. Node Catalysts are worthless |
| Vacuos | Bowl | Aer+Perditio | Aer/Perditio | 6.0 |  |  |
| Venenum | Spider Eye (4) | Aqua+Perditio | Aqua/Perditio | 16.0 |  | Finally, Empowering Bees are responsible for creating the most ridiculous nodes ever witnessed by Thaumaturges, and in record time to boot. If you want to use the Research Completer |
| Vesania | Ethereal Essence [5] | Cognitio+Vitium | Aer/Aqua/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio/Terra | 1.0 |  | multi these buzzing insects are basically required, as the multi will chew through regular nodes too quickly to make it practical to use otherwise |
| Victus | Bamboo (1) | Aqua+Terra | Aqua/Terra | 4.0 |  |  |
| Vinculum | Soul Sand (2) | Motus+Perditio | Aer/Ordo/Perditio | 16.0 |  | Tips and tricks: |
| Vitium | Tainted Fragment (1) [7] | Praecantatio+Perditio | Aer/Ignis/Ordo/Perditio | 48.0 |  | Multiblock Advanced Alchemical Furnaces, at least for reasonably non-strenuous operation, seems to require ~4 Centi-Vis worth of Ignis, Perdition and Aqua to run |
| Vitreus | Quite Clear Glass | Ordo+Terra | Ordo/Terra | 3.0 |  | Magic Mirrors and Everburn Urns only consume 1 Ordo/Ignis Centi-Vis respectively |
| Volatus | Feather (1) | Aer+Motus | Aer/Ordo | 12.0 |  | Advanced Node Jarring does not work if the warded glass/blocks don't all belong to, and are used by, the same player. I can't thoroughly test this, but it has come up, and makes sense |

## Crucible crafting recipes

Early on you're going to be relying on throwing stuff in a crucible to craft items, and the mess that inveriably creates. It's important to understand, especially for people used to TC6's mechanics in 1.12, that TC4 is a lot different in how it handles the concept of magical pollution, as it were. In TC4 the only penalty to messing up with a crucible is creating flux, which wastes Essentia (though the wasted essentia tends to not be useful anyway) and can cause debuffs or spawn thaumic slimes. If you are exceptionally careless with crucible crafting it is possible to create a Tainted Lands biome as well, but this is exceedingly difficult to pull off. In TC4 it's not part of the mod's progression to create a polluted zone and unleash mayhem, it's strictly a penalty for carelessness or relying on inefficient solutions. You don't really have to worry about ruining a base because of crucible mishaps. Paying any measure of attention will prevent it

If you're still worried there's also another solution: Find a Sinister Node (that is not Unstable and Fading), and set up your crucible close to, but not on top of, the node. If you create a Tainted Lands biome through crucible mishaps the Sinister node will overwrite it with regular Eerie biome, killing the Taint altogether

Balanced Shards/Thaumium: 4 of all the primal shards, 5 iron ingots, 5 crystal powder (requires Shard Recrystilization research)

Balance Shards: 5 Mixed Fragments, 1 of each primal shard (Mixed Fragments come from Rosa Mysteria grown on Mixed Crystal Clusters)

Shadow Ore: 8 Magic Planks, 8 Iron Bars (iron nuggets will conflict with Metal Transmutation research), 6 Abyssal Block Slab, 4 Bowls/Empty Bottles (magic planks come from Magic Trees, which are found in Mystic Grove biomes. Craft a Nature's Compass to find the nearest one)
